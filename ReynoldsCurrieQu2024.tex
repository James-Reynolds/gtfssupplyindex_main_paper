\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

A role for transit in many locations is to provide at least a basic
level of mobility so that those who cannot otherwise drive themselves
have some accessibility to activities and services beyond walking
distance \citep{Currie:2016aa}. Age, disability, socio-economic status,
lack of a vehicle or many other factors might make someone reliant on
transit for some or all of their travel. Vertical social-equity
perspectives on transport policy-making, relating to supporting those
who are disadvantaged (c.f. \citet{Litman:2016aa}), might therefore
suggest providing at least some transit, and probably more than just a
minimum, where there are higher social needs for transport. As well,
lower proportions of younger people are obtaining a driving license than
was the case previously \citep{delbosc2013causes}, suggesting the
community's need for transit coverage may be likely to increase into the
future.

\citet{Currie2003Hobart}, \citet{Currie2004Gap};
\citet{Currie2007Identifying} and \citet{currie2010identifying}
developed an approach for identifying spatial gaps in transit supply
related to social needs for transport, and applied it to a case study of
Melbourne in 2006. This was suggested as being ``substantially more
useful than the presentation of anecdotal evidence, which is the most
common means of identifying transport needs in local transport studies
throughout the world'' \citep{currie2010identifying}. However, there
does not appear to have been much further use or development of this
spatial analysis technique. It is unclear whether the identified
geographic patterns are representative of transit supply and social
needs in other places, or if the situation (in Melbourne) has changed in
the intervening years.

This may in part be because until recently schedules was not typically
available in consistent and electronic formats, meaning that assessing
transit supply was a large task requiring bespoke sourcing, cleaning and
analysis of data for each transit operator. Nowadays, however, more than
10,000 transit agencies publicly release timetable data in the General
Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format \citep{GTFS}. Such
standardisation allows Google Maps and other online platforms to provide
transit-related outputs for any place publishing a feed. It also
facilitates data access and processing for research purposes. However,
tools for using GTFS data to examine spatial patterns and gaps in
transit supply with respect to social needs for transport do not appear
to be readily available. This gap, and the lack of direct follow up to
\citet{Currie2003Hobart}, \citet{Currie2004Gap},
\citet{Currie2007Identifying} and \citet{currie2010identifying}, provide
motivation for this research.

Ojectives of this research are: (1) to develop tools for undertaking
needs-gap analysis using GTFS datasets; and (2) to understand spatial
patterns of gaps between social needs for transport and transit supply,
including whether those reported in \citet{Currie2007Identifying} and
\citet{currie2010identifying} are consistent with the current situation.
Research outcomes that are reported in this paper include the
development of a new R package (gtfssupplyindex) with tools for using
the \citet{Currie2007Identifying} and \citet{currie2010identifying}
analysis approach with GTFS datasets. Also presented in this paper are
results for Melbourne in 2016 and 2021, matching the most recent
censuses, for comparison to the 2006 results reported in
\citet{currie2010identifying}\footnote{The wider programme of research
  includes examination of spatial gaps in other cities, so as to better
  understand whether patterns in Melbourne are representative of other
  places. However, this paper is limited to examining Melbourne in 2016
  and 2021 only. Results for other cities will be reported elsewhere.}.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: the next section
outlines the research context; Section 3 describes the study
methodology; results are presented in Section 4 and discussed in Section
5; and limitations of this study and directions for future research are
discussed in Section 6, which concludes the paper.

\hypertarget{research-context}{%
\section{Research context}\label{research-context}}

There are many metrics available for assessing transit services.
Examples include: those in the \emph{Transit Cooperative Research
Program (TCRP) Report 88: a guidebook for developing
performance-measurement systems} \citep{Ryus:2003aa}; and those used
across benchmarking databases and programs such as by
\citet{Florida-Transit-Information-System:2018aa}, \citet{UITP:2015aa}
and \citet{Imperial-College-London:2023aa}. The Fielding Triangle
\citep{FieldingGordonJ1987Mpts} provides a framework for combining
indicators of service inputs, outputs and consumption to describe cost
efficiency, cost effectiveness and service effectiveness. More broadly:
\citet{Litman:2003ab} and \citet{Litman:2016aa} discuss the traffic,
mobility, accessibility, social equity, strategic planning and other
rational decision-making perspectives underlying many transport
indicators; \citet{Reynolds:2017ah} extends these into models of how
institutionalism, incrementalism and other public policy analysis
concepts might apply to transit prioritisation;
\citet{GuzmanLuisA.2017Aeit} developed a measure of accessibility in the
context of policy development and social equity for Latin American Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) networks; and
\citet{Creutzig2020streetspaceallocation} introduced street space
allocation metrics based around ten ethical principles.

Many such metrics, however, may be difficult to calculate, understand or
use, especially for those who are not planners, engineers or other
technical specialists. Where pre-calculated transit metrics are
immediately available, such as on a website, it may not be possible to
independently generate scores or assess proposed system changes.
Contrasting examples are provided by:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Transit Scores} \citep{WalkScore:2023tg},\\
  are readily available online. The meaning of the metric appears
  simple, with the highest possible score of 100 representing the sort
  of transit accessibility experienced in the center of New York.
  However, the algorithm is secret, and scores cannot be calculated
  independently.
\item
  The \emph{Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM)},
  which provides metrics for measuring many different aspects of a
  transit system. Scores are consistently grouped into five categories,
  providing a simple ranking from very good to not very good, and can be
  independently calculated (with sufficient data). However, there are
  many metrics,\\
  which may complexity to using TCQSM scores for communication with
  non-technical audiences (e.g.~the public, politicians or other
  stakeholders).
\end{itemize}

GTFS datasets have allowed the application of such metrics to many
transit systems with, for example, the \emph{Transit Score} website
reporting scores across the world. \citet{Wong:2013aa} provides another
example, in reporting the distribution of various TCQSM metrics across
50 USA transit operators. Code used in the \citet{Wong:2013aa} analysis
is available for those who might wish to produce similar analysis for
other locations or time periods. The lack of a similar code base for
calculating metrics associated with spatial gaps in transit supply with
respect to social needs provides motivation for the research reported in
this paper.

\hypertarget{the-transit-suppy-index}{%
\subsection{The Transit Suppy Index}\label{the-transit-suppy-index}}

A generalized form of the SI equation, adapted from
\citet{currie2010identifying}, is:

\[SI_{area, time} = \sum{\frac{Area_{Bn}}{Area_{area}}SL_{n, time}}\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(SI_{area, time}\) is the Supply Index for the area of interest and a
  given period of time;
\item
  \(Area_{Bn}\) is the buffer area for each stop (n) within the area of
  interest (in \citet{currie2010identifying} this was based on a radius
  of 400 metres for bus and tram stops, and 800 metres for railway
  stations);
\item
  \(Area_{area}\) is the area of the area of interest; and
\item
  \(SL_{n,time}\) is the number of transit arrivals for each stop for a
  given time period.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\citet{currie2010identifying} reported SI scores for Census Collection
Districts (CCDs) across Melbourne in 2006. These were used to categorise
service levels into seven groups, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:Currie_map_SI}(a). General patterns were identified, being:
more transit supply in the inner and middle suburbs, and along passenger
railway lines; and outer areas tending to have very low supply or no
transit at all.

\hypertarget{social-need-and-needs-gap}{%
\subsection{Social need and needs-gap}\label{social-need-and-needs-gap}}

\citet{currie2010identifying} assessed the social need for transport
across Melbourne using a composite index including: the Australian
Bureau of Statistics' (ABS') Index of Related Socio-Economic
Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD) and a transport needs index derived from
eight weighted indicators. The spatial distribution of this composite
social needs index, reproduced in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI}(b),
showed that areas of above average, high and very high social needs were
located in: some outer suburbs, particularly in the east and south-east;
and in some middle suburbs in the south-east, north and west.

\citet{currie2010identifying} compared social needs and Supply Index
scores (Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI}(c)) and identified areas with
very high transport needs, but very low or zero transit supply (Figure
\ref{fig:Currie_map_SI}(d)), where service gaps might be of particular
concern. Most of these were located in the outer suburbs of Melbourne in
the north-east, south-east and south, although there were also some
pockets in the middle suburbs in the west, north and south east.
Overall, \citet{currie2010identifying} found that ``8.2\% of Melbourne
residents have `very high' needs but `zero', `low' or `very low' public
transport supply.''

It does not appear that this approach has been widely adopted in
practice or by researchers. Our suspicion is that while the SI has a
relatively simple formula and requires only geographic and timetable
data to calculate, a lack of software tools to complete the analysis may
be partly why it has not been more widely adopted. The case-based
methods used in this research to develop such tools are discussed in the
following.

\hypertarget{methodology}{%
\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

Case approaches can be particularly useful when research questions are
about `how' or `why', but researchers lack control of events (preventing
experiments)\citep{Yin2009aa}. Here research questions relate to: (1)
how to use GTFS data to assess gaps between social needs and transit
supply, and (2) how and why spatial patterns might have changed since
those reported for 2006 in \citet{currie2010identifying}. There is no
ability here to control events so a case research approach appears well
suited to this study.

When using a case research approach there is also a need to address the
``duality criterion'', being the need to seek generalisable findings
while at the same time being grounded in the context of only a small
number of cases (allowing the study to go into greater
depth)\citep{Denscombe2007aa, Ketokivi2014aa}. Here the approach taken
has been to develop a package of tools for calculating the SI from GTFS
data using the R programming language \citep{R-base}. Here the duality
criterion is addressed by developing software functions are generic and
might be applied to other GTFS feeds, beyond the Melbourne case reported
in this paper. The recommendations of \citet{wickham2023r} informed the
package setup and development approach. Various existing packages and
code examples were relied upon including: the sf package \citep{R-sf}
for geospatial analysis; the tidyverse \citep{tidyverse2019}; gtfstools
\citep{R-gtfstools}; and tidytransit \citep{R-tidytransit}.

There are, however, limitations to the generalisability of the findings
of this research with respect to changes since 2006 and the patterns
reported in \citet{currie2010identifying}(research question 2).
\citet{Currie2007Identifying} and \citet{currie2010identifying} reported
results for Melbourne only. The \citet{Currie2003Hobart} and
\citet{Currie2004Gap} studies of Hobart and Adelaide used earlier
versions of the needs-gap assessment methodology, for which further
software tools have not been developed. While this study does seek to
findings about changes in spatial patterns of social needs and transit
supply that are generalisable to more than just Melbourne, a lack of
2006 results for other cities may limit the extent to which these
findings might be confidently considered representative of changes in
other places\footnote{Other parts of this research programme will
  examine changes over the last 10-15 years in other cities (where GTFS
  data is available). The focus of this paper, however, is on Melbourne.}.

\hypertarget{code-developement}{%
\subsection{Code developement}\label{code-developement}}

Code was developed and tested on the Mornington Peninsula Tourist
Railway GTFS feed. This was selected primarily for convenience, given
that the authors are familiar with the surrounding geography and that
the feed covers only a small number of trips across just three stations
(thereby facilitating hand verification of outputs). ABS data was used
to define areas of interest, and was sourced via the absmapsdata package
\citep{R-absmapsdata}.

\hypertarget{melbourne-case-study}{%
\subsection{Melbourne Case Study}\label{melbourne-case-study}}

The methodological literature provides guidance on case selection and
discusses various theoretical sampling approaches, including sampling
for critical, particularly revelatory and/or representative cases
\citep{Eisenhardt1989aa, Yin2009aa, Denscombe2007aa, Eisenhardt2007TBfC}.
\citet{Yin2009aa} notes selection of a case to allow longitudinal study,
and this is the primary reason for selecting Melbourne here to
facilitate comparison with the 2006 results reported in
\citet{currie2010identifying}. As such, SI scores were calculated using
the same Census Collection Districts (CCDs) used by
\citet{currie2010identifying}, but for the weeks starting the day of the
2016 and 2021 censuses. The Victorian GTFS feed, published by Public
Transport Victoria (PTV), was used, with historical feeds sourced from
\citet{transitfeeds_victoria:2023aa}.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to obtain 2016 or 2021 social
disadvantage data for CCDs, as the ABS no longer releases data using
this geographic scheme. Instead, population and other statistics are now
released for Statistical Area (SA1) zones, under a hierarchical
structure ranging from SA1s (\textasciitilde400 people) to SA4s (parts
of a city or region). As such, SI scores have also been calculated for
SA1s, to facilitate use of ABS data to identify needs-gaps.

The same Transport Supply categorizations have been used as in
\citet{currie2010identifying}\footnote{Zero, Very Low, Low, Below
  average, Above average, High and Very High.}. As well, this study
adopts a similar approach to measuring social disadvantage as used in
\citet{currie2010identifying}, using: the ABS' IRSAD and a transport
needs index\footnote{The same need indicators and weightings used in
  \citet{currie2010identifying} were adopted, although \$799 or lower
  per week was used as the threshold for low income households rather
  than \$499 to account for inflation (as per the Reserve Bank of
  Australia's online inflation calculator).}. A composite needs
indicator was derived based on the IRSAD and the transport needs index,
again as per the \citet{currie2010identifying} approach. However,
changes to ABS reporting means that the composite needs indicator used
by \citet{currie2010identifying} cannot be exactly replicated. Hence,
the approach used here includes only two components in the composite
needs index\footnote{In contrast to the four of
  \citet{currie2010identifying}, which included two ``relative need''
  components obtained by weighting the IRSAD and the transport needs
  indexes by the population within the various needs groups for each
  area of interest. Current ABS reporting, however, does not allow the
  total number of people within one or more of the various needs groups
  to be identified at the SA1 level.} based on weighting both the IRSAD
index and the transport need index by the total population of each SA1.
These were then standardised and grouped, as per the six groups used by
\citet{currie2010identifying}\footnote{Very Low, Low, Below average,
  Above average, High and Very High.}.

There is a statistically significant difference in the shares of CCDs in
each category between 2006, 2016 and 2021
(\(\chi^2(12, N = 18489) = 87.45\), \(p < .001\)). Only 81 CCDs (1.3\%)
have Zero Supply in 2021, compared to the 189 (3.2\%) reported by
\citet{currie2010identifying} for 2006. Differences are also
statistically significant when comparing 2006 and 2016
(\(\chi^2(6, N = 12164) = 56.87\), \(p < .001\)) or 2006 and 2021
\(\chi^2(6, N = 12164) = 59.15\), \(p < .001\)), but not between 2016
and 2021 (\(\chi^2(6, N = 12650) = 0.67\), \(p = .995\)).

The shares by CCDs, however, are only for 2006 extents of Melbourne, and
the ABS' statistical boundary of ``Greater Melbourne'' now includes
areas up to around 30 kilometers further to the north. Figure
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_CCDs_SA1_population} includes the 2006
boundary as an overlay, indicating that much of the new parts of Greater
Melbourne have Very Low or Zero Supply levels. Again, the difference
between the share of areas of interest in each category in 2006 (CCDs),
2016 and 2021 (SA1s) is statistically significant
(\(\chi^2(12, N = 27615) = 58.86\), \(p < .001\)), but not between 2006
and 2016 (as a pair, \(\chi^2(6, N = 16128) = 8.83\), \(p = .183\)). The
differences between 2006 and 2021 are statistically significant
(\(\chi^2(6, N = 17326) = 44.83\), \(p < .001\)) as are the differences
between 2016 and 2021 \(\chi^2(6, N = 21776) = 31.56\), \(p < .001\)).
There is a greater proportion of SA1s with Zero Supply in 2021 (4.3\%)
than there were CCDs in 2006 (3.25\%) or SA1s in 2016 (3.2\%). The share
of SA1s with supply below the average SI score (i.e.~Zero, Very Low, Low
or Below Average) is also larger in 2021 (74.5\%) compared to the share
of CCDs in 2006 (70.3\%) or share of SA1s in 2016 (72.0\%).

Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_CCDs_SA1_population} compares the share
of resident population in each transport supply category.

Residents in areas with Zero Supply rose from 85,423 (2.5\%) in 2006 to
186,829 (3.8\%) in 2021, representing a 119\% increase. This compares to
the 46\% population increase across all of Greater Melbourne. Residents
with Zero or Very Low Transport Supply rose from 878,469 (26.1\%) in
2006 to 1,319,796 (26.8\%) in 2021, representing a 50\% increase (4\%
higher than population growth). Residents with supply below the average
(Zero, Very Low, Low or Below Average) rose from 2,518,320 (74.8\%) in
2006 to 3,642,937 (74.1\%) in 2021, representing a 45\% increase ( 1\%
lower than the population change).

Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_population_2016_by_SA4} and Table
\ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_population_2021_by_SA4} show the distribution
of Transport Supply categories to the population in each SA4 zone in
2016 and 2021 respectively\footnote{SA4s are the largest of the
  statistical boundaries used by the ABS for areas smaller than Greater
  Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSAs) or other agglomerations. The
  Greater Melbourne GCCSA consists of nine SA4s, all named according to
  geographic location (including the Mornington Peninsula SA4, which is
  at the extreme south of the Melbourne GCCSA).}.

Variations in the share of SA1s in each Transport Supply category across
SA4 zones are statistically significant in both 2016
(\(\chi^2(48, N = 10289) = 6195.85\), \(p < .001\)) and 2021
(\(\chi^2(48, N = 11487) = 7250.39\), \(p < .001\))\footnote{Tables
  showing Transport Supply by number of SA1s for each SA4 are included
  in the Appendix.}. In general, larger shares of residents have lower
than the average supply in outer areas of Greater Melbourne\footnote{The
  North East, North West, Outer East, South East, West and Mornington
  Peninsula SA4 zones}. In 2016, 2,714,128 residents (60.5\% of the
total population of Greater Melbourne) were both living outside of the
inner three SA4s and in SA1s with lower than average supply. By 2021
this had increased to 3,127,365 residents (63.6\% of the total
population).

\hypertarget{supply-index-scores}{%
\subsubsection{Supply Index scores}\label{supply-index-scores}}

\citet{currie2010identifying} reported an average SI score for CCDs in
2006 of 2,886.9 across Melbourne. In comparison, the average SI value
found here for 2021 (using CCDs and within the 2006 boundary) is 3,390.
SI scores of 10,922.7, 2,694.9 and 764.3 were reported for inner, middle
and outer suburbs, respectively, for 2006 in
\citet{currie2010identifying}. For 2021 the SI scores average 12,275.7
(+12\%) , 3,409.1 (+27\%) and 998.96 (31\%) respectively\footnote{The
  same grouping of LGAs to inner, middle and outer suburb groups as used
  in \citet{currie2010identifying} was used for this analysis, although
  here the City of Stonnington was allocated entirely to the middle
  grouping, whereas \citet{currie2010identifying} allocated part of this
  LGA to the inner group.}. However, the \citet{currie2010identifying}
results show 5,839 total CCDs within Melbourne, whereas the shape files
obtained for this analysis include 6,325 CCDs within the 2006 Melbourne
boundary. Hence, results found here might not be exactly comparable to
those in \citet{currie2010identifying} due to geographic
inconsistencies. Overall, however, results appear to be consistent with
there having been increases in SI scores across all parts of Melbourne
since 2006 and the general pattern of higher average SI scores in inner
(and then middle) than outer suburbs remaining unchanged.

It is, however, possible to directly compare SI scores 2016 and 2021,
using the SA1 2021 boundaries. Table
\ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021_ratio_map} shows changes in SI
score between 2016 and 2021 (column 1) by 2021 SA1s for the 2021
population, summarised for each SA4 zone (columns 2 to 10) and Greater
Melbourne as a whole (column 11). These are mapped in Figure

\(p < .001\), \(r_s =.98\), \(p < .001\)).

There is a statistically significant difference in the proportion of
SA1s in each service level change category across SA4 areas
(\(\chi^2(NA) = 2829.67\), \(p < .001\))\footnote{See Appendix for table}.
In 2021, more than half of the population were living in SA1s where the
SI scores were more than one percent higher than in 2016 in the
North-West (305,443 people, 72.0\%) and West (581,781 people, 68.2\%)
SA4s. This compares to slightly more than half of the population across
Greater Melbourne as a whole (2,517,945 people, 51.2\%), and less an a
third in the Inner East (108,918 people, 29.2\%) and Outer East (116,804
people, 22.5\%) SA4s.

Service levels in 2021 stayed within one percent of the level in 2016
for most of the people living in the Outer East (274,423 people, 52.9\%)
and Inner East (187,974 people, 50.3\%). For Greater Melbourne as a
whole\\
1,393,581 people ( 28.3\%) where living in SA1s in 2021 where the SI
scores had remainded within one percent of the 2016 value.

In 2021, the share of the population living in SA1s where the SI was
more than one percent lower than in 2016 was largest in the Inner
(174,615 people, 28.3\%), Inner South (100,869 people, 23.9\%) and Outer
East (114,281 people, 22.0\%) SA4s. Accross all of Greater Melbourne
825,124 people, 16.8\%) were living in SA1s in 2021 was more than one
percent lower than it had been in 2016.

In 2021 180,983 residents of Greater Melbourne ( 3.7\%) were living in
SA1s that did not have transit service in 2016 or 2021. The largest
proportions were amongst the Mornington Peninsula (7.8\%, 23,958) and
South East (6.1\%, 52,606) SA4s, whereas no one at all in the Inner SA4
was living in a SA1 without at least a Very Low service level.

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_social_needs} shows the
distribution of categories of social need index scores across Greater
Melbourne for 2021\footnote{A map for 2016 is included in the Appendix
  as Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_social_needs_appendix}}.
This is analogous to the 2006 map shown in Figure
\ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} (b) although, as discussed in the methodology
section above, it was not possible to exactly replicate the
\citet{currie2010identifying} social needs scoring approach due to
changes in the way census results are reported. In general, the spatial
grouping of different levels of social need appears less consistently
grouped in 2021 than in 2006, although this may be an artifact of the
shift to SA1s from CCDs\footnote{CCDs were originally devised to group
  the approximately 200 dwellings allocated to each individual census
  collector, whereas SA1s were introduced to be consistent in population
  (200 to 800 people, averaging 400) and character \citep{ABS_SA1s_CCDs}}.

Figures \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_scatterplot_figure}
and \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_scatterplot_figure} show
social needs and SI scores\footnote{To improve the clarity of the

SA1s with combinations of Zero or Very Low Transport Supply and
(especially) high needs scores (more than 40); or Very High supply and
Very Low needs scores (less than 4.5) have been labelled with their SA2
name, so as to given an indication of which suburbs of Melbourne are at
each of the extremes. There is a significant, but only weakly positive
correlation between the SI and Combined Needs Index scores for both 2016
(\(r(11136) = .06\), \(p < .001\), \(r_s =.07\), \(p < .001\)) and 2021
(\(r(11136) = .06\), \(p < .001\), \(r_s =.07\), \(p < .001\)).

Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_population} compares the
populations within each Transport Supply and Combined Needs Index
grouping for 2016. There is a statistically significant relationship
(\(\chi^2(30, N = 4471171) = 158778.27\), \(p < .001\)). 301,743 people
live within SA1s that have Zero or Very Low Transport Supply, but Very
High social needs. This represents 6.7\% of the 4,471,171 people within
Greater Melbourne, and is higher proportion than that reported for 2006
(139,004 of 3.3 million people (4.2\%)). These areas are mapped for by
2016 and 2021 in Figure
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_map_figure}

Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_population} shows the
same comparison for 2021. There is a statistically significant
relationship (\(\chi^2(30, N = 4904313) = 55715.62\), \(p < .001\)).
333,887 people live within SA1s that have Zero or Very Low Transport
Supply, but Very High social needs. This represents 6.8\% of the
4,904,313 people within Greater Melbourne, which is higher than that
reported for both 2006 and 2016.

Figures \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_map_figure} and
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_map_figure} show SA1 zones in
Greater Melbourne with Very High transport needs, but Very Low or Zero
Transport Supply for 2016 and 2021. Comparison to the 2006 spatial
distribution shown in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} (bottom) suggests
that areas with large gaps between social needs and Transport Supply
continue to be mostly in the outer areas of Melbourne. However, such
comparisons appear complicated by the larger number of SA1s than CCDs,
with Figures \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_map_figure} and
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_map_figure} appearing to show
more (smaller) areas with Very High transport needs, but Very Low or
Zero Transport Supply. This includes areas in the West, North West,
North East and South East SA4s, whereas in 2006 these parts of Melbourne
did not appear to have large gaps between need and supply. The bottom
parts of the Morning Peninsula (around Blairgowrie) drop out of the
category of having the largest needs-gaps in 2016, but are back in this
category again in 2021.

There is a significant difference across SA4s in 2016
(\(\chi^2(NA) = 148541.79\), \(p < .001\)) and 2021
(\(\chi^2(NA) = 122162.32\), \(p < .001\)). Of those people living in
SA1s that Very High needs but Very Low or Zero service in 2016, those
living in the North West, South East and West were more likely to have
received some new or additional transit service by 2021. For those
living in the Outer East, Inner South and Mornington Peninsula service
levels were more likely to have stayed within one percent or been
reduced, or (for 663 people living in the Outer East (2.8\%)) had their
Service withdrawn (magenta) entirely.

A larger proportion of those living in the Inner South, North East, West
or Mornington Peninsula who were living in SA1s with Very High needs but
Very Low or Zero service in 2021 had seen service levels reduced by more
than one percent or had services withdrawn entirely or not providing in
2016 or 2021. This included the 1,315 people living in the North East
(3.1\% of residents) and 718 people living in the South East (0.8\% of
residents). A further 630 people living in the Outer East in 2021 (2.1\%
of residents) were living in SA1s with Very High needs but Very Low or
Zero service in 2021, which had some transit service in 2016 but none in
2021. A larger proportion of the population were living in SA1s with
Very High needs but Very Low or Zero service in 2021 had not had service
in 2016 or 2021 in the South East (15.1\%, 12,847), West (15.3\%, 12,742

Service levels had increased (by more than one percent) for those living
in SA1s with Very High needs but Very Low or Zero service in 2021 for a
larger proportion of those living in the North West (73.8\%, 30,776

45,464 residents). However, even those service levels had increased,
they still remained in the Very Low category.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

This research was motivated by a lack of software tools to analyse gaps
between social needs for transport and the amount of transit provided,
and to better understand how spatial patterns might have changed since
the original development of this methodology in the early 2000s. The
needs-gaps approach was suggested to be ``substantially more useful than
the presentation of anecdotal evidence, which is the most common means
of identifying transport needs in local transport studies throughout the
world'' \citep{currie2010identifying}, yet this technique does not
appear to have been adopted in practice. The research reported in this
paper, therefore, is important because it may help bridge gaps between
research (where the needs-gap approach and SI formulation was developed)
and the real world of transport planning, advocacy, professional
practice and politics (where decisions are made about where transit
services are needed or need improving).

As discussed in Section 2, there are many transit metrics available, but
these may be challenging to apply or calculate independently. The SI has
the advantage of combining accessibility and service frequency into a
single measure, which is relatively simple to understand and can even be
calculated by hand for smaller networks. With the gtfstools R package
developed in this research applying the SI calculation across even
relatively large transit networks, such as that of Greater Melbourne,
requires only a GTFS feed, some computer time and a bit of data
scientist know-how (or a willingness and time to learn). The tool is not
yet at a download, point and click level of useability. However, it is
open source and publicly available, and so may make it easier to assess
transit service levels and network change proposals with respect to
social needs for transport.

The maps, graphs, tables and other outputs presented in this paper also
demonstrate the range of analysis that might be possible using this
package. Longitudinal comparison of transit service levels has been
shown in aggregate (Table
\ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_CCDs_SA1_population}), by population across
sub-areas (in comparing Tables
\ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_population_2016_by_SA4} and
\ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_population_2016_by_SA4}) and mapped (Figure
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021_ratio_map}). Visual display of gaps
between social needs and Transport Supply how also been shown through
scatterplots (Figures
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_scatterplot} and
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_scatterplot}) and mapping
(Figures \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_map} and
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_map}). Such outputs,
especially if produced at the spatial level of a neighbourhood, council
ward or electoral division, might provide an opportunity for advocates
and professionals within transport planning to identify and easily
demonstrate to the public, politician and other stakeholders which
spatial areas might benefit from increasing transit funding and where
funds might best be directed.

Previous research looking at bus services in new developments includes
the \citet{delbosc2015impact} case study of the Selandra Rise planned
estate in the south-east of Melbourne. This study explored the impact of
the, then newly introduced, 798 bus route (Figure \ref{fig:Bus_798}. The
route was reported as having around 2,500 boardings per week and being
used by at least one person in 35 percent of households within the
Selandra Rise Estate, despite it not penetrating fully into the
development and only 20 percent of the estate's footprint being within
400 metres of the route. Findings suggested that: the route was
``performing an important `social transit' function''; that ``those who
do use the bus use it very frequently (88 percent (of riders) at least a
few days a week)''; ``Most bus riders were young and could not drive or
had no car available, making them quite reliant on the bus'', and that
it ``frees up the time of other household members who would have had to
provide lifts'' \citep[p.10]{delbosc2015impact}. Figure
\ref{fig:Selandra_rise} revisits the Selandra Rise Estate, showing
Transport Supply in 2016 and 2021, and changes in SI score for SA1s with
Very High social needs, but Very Low or Zero Transport Supply.

\caption{Bus Route 798 as originally introduced in 2014 (Source: Delbosc et al (2015))}\label{fig:Bus_798}
\end{figure}

Various transit routes appear to have been added to the area surrounding
the Selandra Rise Estate between 2016 (Figure \ref{fig:Selandra_rise},
top-left), 2021 (top-right) and 2024 (bottom-right). After 2016 Route
798 was adjusted to penetrate into the estate, and Route 888 was added
to provide a north-south connection along Berwick-Cranbourne Road. This
appears to have been sufficient to shift some of the estate into the Low
Transport Supply category in 2021, up from Very Low category in 2016.
Figure \ref{fig:Selandra_rise}, bottom-left, however, indicates that
some of the surrounding SA1s, however, still fall into the Very High
needs and Very Low or Zero supply social needs-gap category, including
some SA1s that have over 700 residents but did not have a transit
service within 400 metres in either 2016 and 2021. That said, it appears
that Route 898 has been added between 2021 and 2024, providing an
additional east-west connection and coverage, suggesting that the
ultimate transit network for the area is not yet implemented.

What the information shown in the bottom-left and bottom-right of Figure
\ref{fig:Selandra_rise} might suggest, however, is that areas in the
vicinity of Casey Fields are underserved. Revising Route 795 so as to
service areas north of Ballarto Rd, perhaps instead of duplicating parts
of Route 796, might be one option to increase coverage and provide some
stops for residents living in areas that did not have an transit within
400 metres in either 2016 or 2021.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

This paper has reported the development of a new R package containing
tools for identifying gaps between the social need for transport and the
service provided based on GTFS data. It has also demonstrated how this
package might be applied to the case of Greater Melbourne in 2016 and
2021, in the same manner in which \citet{currie2010identifying} applied
the analysis approach to Melbourne in 2006.

A motivation for this study was explore how spatial patterns related to
Transport Supply, need and gaps have changed in Melbourne since 2006. To
some extent the results indicate the challenges of making longitudinal
comparisons when there are changes in statistical geography. The shift
from CCDs to SA1s by the ABS appears to have allowed results to be
output here are a finer scale than in 2006, due to the generally smaller
size of SA1s and the way in which they are focused towards containing
consistent land use patterns within each zone. This contrasts to the
CCDs, which instead denoted the areas within which one census collector
operated. Unfortunately, this limits the extend to which the 2016 and
2021 results can be directly compared to those for 2006. However, it is
notable that the share of the population living in areas wtih Zero
Transport Supply grew with time from 2.5\% (85,423 residents) in 2006 to
2.9\% (131,619 residents) in 2016, and then again to 3.8\% (186,829
residents) in 2021. How much of the change between 2006 and 2016 relates
to the switch in statistical geography is unclear, but the difference
between 2016 and 2021 suggests that more people and a greater proportion
of the population are living in areas where transit stops are beyond
typical walking access distance as time has marched on.

Compared to the 8.2 percent (276,739) of Melbourne residents having very
high needs but zero, low or, very low Transport Supply in 2006 reported
by \citet{currie2010identifying}, this study found the equivalents to be
11.2\% (502,680 residents) in 2016 and 11.2\% ( 301,743 residents) in
2021. Again, the 2016 and 2021 values may not directly comparable to
those from 2006 because of the statistical geography changes. However,
these findings might again suggest that the situation is moving in the
wrong direction, at least in Greater Melbourne.

The extent to which the findings from this case study of Greater
Melbourne can be confidently generalised to other places (relating to
the duality criterion of case research) is a key question. Fortunately,
the widespread availability of GTFS datasets together with the new
gtfssupplyindex package means that it will be easier to analyse other
cases. Exploring social needs-gaps in other Australian cities is an
immediate direction for future efforts associated with this program of
research. In the meantime, it would seem prudent to be cautious as to
making assumptions about whether shifts in Melbourne are representative
of everywhere else. The almost 50 percent growth in population in
Greater Melbourne between 2006 (3.4m) and 2021 (4.9m) is towards the
higher end of that experienced in other places (REFERENCE), although
low-density development patterns that provide similar challenges for
transit planning appear common both within and beyond Australia. The
balance of spending between major projects (e.g.~highways, rail-based
transit) and introducing or increasing the levels of service of transit
provided primarily to meet social needs for transport will be different
in Melbourne to that in other locations. However, with a new subway
connection through the CBD and a second freeway connection across the
largest river currently under construction, and various other rail and
road mega-projects either in planning or recently completed, Melbourne
might be an outlier as far as the share of government spending going
towards transport that is not focused on providing basic coverage for
those who cannot otherwise drive or increasing service levels for those
with the greatest social need for transit. The challenges in building
business cases, increasing subsidies and otherwise introducing or
increasing transit service would appear likely to be similar in
Melbourne as to other places. Hence, it might be confidentially expected
that the overall patterns, of the largest gaps between the social need
for transport and the transit supplied being in outer suburbs and away
from suburban railway lines, might be reasonably expected in other
cities.

As well as making comparisons of Melbourne across 2006, 2016 and 2021,
this paper has expanded on the analysis approach developed in
\citet{Currie2003Hobart}, \citet{Currie2004Gap},
\citet{Currie2007Identifying} and \citet{currie2010identifying}. The
mapping of changes in SI scores (Figure
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021_ratio_map}) and how these changes
relate to transit routes and areas with large needs-gaps at a
neighbourhood (Figure \ref{fig:Selandra_rise}) might be of use to
transport planners, advocates, politicians and other decision-makers,
and others seeking to build legitimacy for the improvement or
introduction of basic transit service levels. It is heartening that the
Selandra Rise Estate, where \citet{delbosc2015impact} found that what
transit was initially implemented provide a very important social
function and that there was a community desire for greater levels of
service, now has more routes and higher service levels. However, Figure
\ref{fig:Selandra_rise} shows that there were similarly
under-or-never-served communities nearby in 2021, suggesting that the
timely introduction of transit service to new development areas
continues to be a challenge in parts of Melbourne. Further research
might seek to confirm whether similar issues are evident in outer and
new development areas of other cities, although this would seem likely
to be the case in many other places.

Overall, the research reported in this paper may help researchers,
practitioners, advocates, other stakeholders and decision-makers obtain
information about spatial areas that have gaps between the social need
for transport and the transit supplied. \citet{currie2010identifying}
suggested that using the Supply Index and needs-gap analysis techniques
would be much preferable to anecdotal or other informal inputs to
decision-making related to providing transit to meet the basic social
needs for transport of communities. The software package and analysis
approaches reported in this paper, enabling GTFS data to be directly
used as an input, will hopefully allow the social needs-gap approach to
be used more easily and widely.

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_social_needs_appendix} shows the
spatial patterns of social needs in 2016. Compared to 2021, the spatial
patterns appear similar, with some areas in the north-west (Gisborne)
and south-east (Carrum Downs, Stoney Point) having Very High needs in
both. Some caution may be required in making direct comparisons of many
outer suburbs where residential development has led to the introduction
of new SA1s for the 2021 census. In many areas, including in the
south-west (Werribee), north-west (Romsey), north (Wallan, Beveridge,
Mickleham) and south-east (Clyde North and Beaconsfield South), it
appears there are still Very High transport needs but the spatial area
covered on the map is much smaller due to the redistricting of larger
SA1s into multiple SA1s. That said, it appears that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  social needs fell in the southern parts of Bacchus Marsh and areas
  around Melton (outer west);
\item
  social needs rose in some outer northern (Lancefield), eastern
  (Gembrook East) and southern (end of the Mornington Penninsula) areas.
\end{itemize}
