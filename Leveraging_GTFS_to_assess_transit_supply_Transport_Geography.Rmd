# Introduction
While "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it" is often miss-attributed to @Deming1993new, 
who was trying to
make the opposite point [@Berenson2016in], 
service level indicators 
are an important part of 
researching, 
managing 
and seeking to improve transit operations 
[@FieldingGordonJ1987Mpts; @Ryus:2003aa]. 
A wide range of indicators already exist 
including, for example: 
those in the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM)[@TCQSM:2013] and
the Transit Score metric [@WalkScore:2023tg].

Practitioners, 
researchers 
and advocates 
using such metrics 
may face two inter-related challenges: 
(1) calculating the metrics themselves 
for a specific location 
and service pattern; and
(2) explaining the metrics, 
their meaning 
and importance 
to those who 
might not be specialists in transit, 
such as to politicians 
or the general public. For example, the TCQSM 
metrics appear difficult to calculate in practice without access to specialist software and data.  But, they appear relatively easy to explain given they use an A to F scoring system and there is an entire guidebook about them (although this may be offset by large number of indicators). 
In contrast, 
Transit Scores can be obtained 
simply by typing an address into a website, 
which will report a score out of 100 
reflecting the quantity of transit available. 
However, Transit Scores cannot be calculated independently 
as the  methodolgy / algorithm is 
not publicly available.


Previous research by @currie2007identifying developed a transit Supply Index (SI) metric that appears to be both 
relatively easy to calculate and 
relatively simple to explain 
to non-transport professionals. 
It is obtained by calculating 
the number of transit arrivals 
at each stop within an area of interest, 
with an adjustment made to account for 
the typical walking distance catchment. 
Higher SI scores indicate 
areas with higher frequency 
and/or better coverage. 

Unfortunately, 
the SI does not appear to have been widely used,
perhaps in part because at the time it was first published 
timetable data was not publicly available 
in a standardized 
and machine-readable format. 
The scores reported in Currie and Senbergs (2007)
were calculated directly from a database of services 
provided by the transit authority 
in Melbourne, Australia. 
Since then, however, 
the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) 
has been developed 
as a way to publish timetable data 
in a standardized format.  
More than 10,000 agencies 
are now providing GTFS feeds^[There are two forms: 
GTFS-static consisting of the timetable data (the scheduled services); 
and GTFS-realtime, which includes vehicle arrivals and departure times based on real-world position data. 
This paper and project uses only the GTFS-static (timetable) format.] 
[@GTFS], 
and many visulization, procession and analysis tools 
are now available. 
A gap, however, is that 
there is not yet a tool to calculate SI scores directly from 
a GTFS dataset. 
This provides the motivation 
for the research reported in this paper, in which a new R package (gtfssupplyindex) specifically developed to calculate SI scores 
is presented. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:
the next seciton outlines the background to this research,
including the original formulation of the Transit Supply Index, 
and an explanation of the GTFS. 
Section 3 then describes the study methodology, 
followed by a brief presentation of results in Section 4. 
Section 5 discusses the results, 
outlines directions for future research 
and provides a conclusion. 

# Background

## Transit metrics
Even a brief search reveals 
many metrics 
available for benchmarking transit services. 
Examples include: 
(1) those in the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Report 88, which is an extensive guidebook on developing a performance-measurement system [@Ryus:2003aa]; 
(2) online databases provided by 
the Florida Transit Information System (FTIS) [@Florida-Transit-Information-System:2018aa] 
and @UITP:2015aa; 
(3) those used in the extensive annual benchmarking programme 
undertaken yearly by the Transport Strategy Centre, 
which includes over 100 transit providers around the world [@Imperial-College-London:2023aa]; and
(4) a recently developed methodology to calculate 'blank spots' within an area, 
being those places beyond 400/800 metre walking distances to/from bus and tram stops/train stations [@AlamriSultan2023GAoA]. 
  
  
The Fielding Triangle [@FieldingGordonJ1987Mpts] provides a framework 
for understanding how such metrics combine 
service inputs, 
service outputs 
and service consumption.  
These can help describe cost efficiency, 
cost effectiveness 
or service effectiveness. 
At a larger scale, 
@Litman:2003ab 
and @Litman:2016aa 
discuss some of the traffic, 
mobility, 
accessibility, 
social equity, 
strategic planning 
and other rational decision-making frames 
that might underlie such transit metrics, 
while @Reynolds:2017ah extends into models of how 
institutionalism, 
incrementalism 
and other public policy analysis concepts 
might apply to decision-making processes. 
Further examples include:
(1) @GuzmanLuisA.2017Aeit, 
who develop a measure of accessibility 
in the context of policy development 
and social equity 
for Latin American Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) networks; and 
(2) the street space allocation metrics 
based around 10 ethical principles 
introduced by @Creutzig2020streetspaceallocation. 

However, 
many of these metrics appear difficult to calculate, 
complex to explain or understand, 
and likely not well suited to communication 
with those who are not transit planners or engineers, or other technical specialists. 
Where pre-calculated metrics 
are immediately available 
it may not be possible for  practitioners, 
researchers 
or advocates 
to independently generate metrics for proposed system changes. 
Sometimes it is not even possible 
to know precisesly how scores for the existing services levels are calculated. 
For example, 
Transit Scores 
for locations with a published GTFS feed 
are readily available on the @WalkScore:2023tg website, 
eliminating the need for any calculations. 
The meaning of these Transit Scores 
appears easy to explain, 
as the highest possible score of 100 
represents what might be experienced in the centre of New York. 
However, 
the Transit Score algorithm 
is patented 
and effectively a black box. 
It is not possible to calculate scores independently. 
Nor does it appear to be possible 
for Transit Scores to be generated for proposed changes to networks. 
Transit Score, therefore, 
fails the first of the aforementioned challenges, 
as practitioners, researchers and advocates 
can only use those scores provided online.
The metric is simple to explain: 
the closer to 100, the better. 
However, because it is based on 
a patented algorithm it may not be easy to understand or explain 
the connection between real-world conditions 
and the Transit Score, 
or what might need to be done 
to improve the score and service levels. 
As such, it might partially 
pass the second of the aforementioned challenges, 
as it is simple to understand, 
yet may not withstand scrutiny.  


Another example is the TCQSM, 
which specifies Levels of Service (LOS) 
between A and F 
across a range of factors^[
Including service span, 
frequency, 
speed, 
the proportion of the population serviced, 
competitiveness of travel times to car-based travel, 
and many more.]. 
This scoring scheme appears relatively simple to explain^[
A is good and F is bad. 
Also this scoring system matches the A to F LOS scoring used in many traffic capacity analysis software and manuals.], 
and the detail within @TCQSM:2013 
provides a resource for anyone wanting to better understand what the scores mean. 
However, 
calculation of many of TCQSM metrics may need specialised software 
and datasets^[
For example, 
the Service Coverage Area metric in the TCQSM (pp. 5-8 to 5-21) 
may require GIS or other analysis, 
on top of accurate data about population densities, 
stop locations 
and service schedules.] 
and it might be challenging to explain 
the detail of these measures 
or how to improve them 
to non-technical decision-makers, 
stakeholders 
or others involved in transit management or advocacy. 

## GTFS
The introduction of the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) 
and widespread release of schedule data in this format, 
however, 
has helped towards making transit metrics more broadly available and usable. 
GTFS is an open, 
text-based format 
that was developed originally to allow transit information to be included in the Google Maps navigation platform [@GTFS]. 

```{r GTFS_ERD, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "GTFS entity relationship diagram. Source: adapted by author from Alamri et al (2023) and the GTFS Schedule Reference (16/11/2023 revision).", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/GTFS.png")

```

Figure 1 shows an Entity Relationship Diargram (ERD) of the GTFS data structure. Each box represents a database table in the GTFS, with table rows indicating the variables (columns) included in each^[For example, each record in the 'stops' table includes a value for stop_id, stop_name, stop_lat and stop_lon.]. Relationships between the tables are indicated by the connecting lines, and Primary Key (PK) and Foreign Key (FK) designations^[For example, stop_id also appears in the 'stop_times' table as a Primary Key and Foreign Key.]. `Crow's feet' indicate the relationships between each table^[See https://i.stack.imgur.com/fxaAq.png for guide to the symbols. But, for example, the stops table is required, with the stop_id field providing a unique (primary) key for every stop. Within the stop_times table (which is also required) the stop_id field is a foreign key. Each unique stop_id can appear many times in the stop_times table, but must appear only once in the stops table. In the stop_times table each combination of trip_id, stop_id and arrival time must be unique (But, see note 2!) meaning that these fields represent a composite key.].

GTFS now provides a mechanism 
for including individual transit systems 
in many online products and analyseses, 
including the Transit Score metric itself. 
@Wong:2013aa provides another example of what can be done with GTFS data, 
having developed code to calculate of some of the TCQSM metrics^[
Daily average headways, 
route length 
and stop numbers 
for 50 transit operators.]. 
While the @Wong:2013aa open-source code is readily available^[
https://github.com/jcwong86/GTFS_Explore_Tool] 
this is now 11 years old 
and does not appear to be currently maintained. 
Future research may involve 
reviewing this code 
and using it to analyse modern GTFS feeds. 
However, 
in this paper the aim is more modest, 
being to use GTFS data to calculate Currie and Senbergs' (2007) SI.   



## The Transit Suppy Index
A generalized form of the Transit Supply Index (SI) is shown in Equation 1^[Currie and Senbergs (2007) focus 
was the context of Melbourne's Census Collection Districts (CCD) 
and calculations based on a week of transit service. 
CCDs predate the introduction of 
Statistical Areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 (SA1, SA2, SA3, SA4), 
and other geographical divisions 
currently used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 
which may be more familiar to readers from down under.]. 

  $$SI_{area, time} = \sum{\frac{Area_{Bn}}{Area_{area}}*SL_{n, time}}$$
 In Equation 1:
 
(1) $SI_{area, time}$ is the Supply Index for the area of interest 
and a given period of time;
(2) $Area_{Bn}$ is the buffer area for each stop (n) within the area of interest. 
In Currie and Senbergs (2007) this was based on 
a radius of 400 metres for bus and tram stops, 
and 800 metres for railway stations;
(3) $Area_{area}$ is the area of the area of interest; and
(4) $SL_{n,time}$ is the number of transit arrivals for each stop 
for a given time period.

An advantage of the SI is 
that it is a relatively simple number 
to calculate, 
understand 
and explain. 
It describes 
the number of transit arrivals 
at stops within 
an area of interest 
and time frame, 
multiplied by a factor 
accounting for the proportion of the area of interest that is within typical walking distance of each stop. 
Hence, 
more services, 
more stops 
and higher frequencies 
increase the score. 
However, the SI does not incorporate 
service span, 
speed 
or other elements of a transit service. 
While these may be important 
to passenger experience, 
they might add considerable complexity. 
Simplicity is also helped 
by the way 
that the SI is additive, 
in that $SI_{area, time}$ scores can be aggregated 
to calculate an overall score 
across multiple time periods 
or for a region encompassing multiple areas of interest. 


# Methodology
This study involved the development of a package with tools for calculating the SI from GTFS data. R [@R-base], a widely used and readily available  statistical programming language, was adopted for code development. The package development setup and workflow described by @wickham2023r 
was adopted in this study. Various existing packages were relied upon including: the sf package [@R-sf] for geospatial analysis; the tidyverse [@tidyverse2019]; gtfstools [@R-gtfstools]; and tidytransit [@R-tidytransit]. Some code was adapted from examples, vignettes and other documentation in the tidytransit, gtfstools and other packages.

Two cases where used as during the code development and testing so that results might be generated for real GTFS data.  These were the Mornington Peninsula Tourist Railway GTFS feed and the Public Transport Victoria (PTV) GTFS feed, both in Victoria, Australia. Both were selected primarily for convenience, given that the authors are familiar with the typical service patterns and geography. Further cases were selected as leading, representative and contrasting examples for the results reported here. 


## Mornington Penninsula Tourist Railway

The Morning Penninsula Tourist Railway is located in the outer south-eastern suburbs of Greater Melbourne. It runs on Sundays and Wednesdays between Moorooduc and Mornington, with an intermediate stop at Tanti Park^[https://transitfeeds.com/p/mornington-railway/806/latest/stops]. A GTFS feed from 2018 was selected for the purposes of tests and demonstrating the code and output. Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data was also used, 
primarily through the strayr 
and absmapsdata packages [@r-strayr].
The Mornington Peninsular Statistical Area 3 (SA3) zone and the Statistical Area 1 (SA1) zones contained within it were adopted as the areas_of_interest. These are shown in Figure 1, together with the three railway stations.  

```{r mornington_map, fig.cap = "Mornington Penninsula SA1 zones and location of Mornington Tourist Rail stops.", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

#  sf::st_write(mornington_sa12021, "inst/extdata/mornington_sa12021.geojson", append=FALSE)
#  return(mornington_sa12021)
#}
#get_mornington_sa3 <- function(){

#  sf::st_write(mornington_sa32021, "inst/extdata/mornington_sa32021.geojson", append=FALSE)
#  return(mornington_sa32021)
#}

areas_of_interest <- load_areas_of_interest(areas_of_interest = absmapsdata::sa12021 %>% filter(sa3_name_2021 == "Mornington Peninsula") %>% select(sa1_code_2021), 
  area_id_field = "sa1_code_2021")

# map the areas_of_interest
map <- areas_of_interest %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(geometry = geometry))
#map
#set the EPSG to transform from lat/lon to metres
EPSG_for_transform = 28355

#load the revised mornington GTFS data
list_gtfs = gtfssupplyindex:::gtfs_by_route_type(system.file(
  "extdata/mornington180109",
  "gtfs.zip", 
  package = "gtfssupplyindex", 
  mustWork = TRUE))
stops_as_sf_mornington <-  list_gtfs[[1]]$stops %>% 
  tidytransit::stops_as_sf()

#map the stops on the ABS data
map + 
  geom_sf(data = stops_as_sf_mornington, aes(geometry = geometry))

stops_in_or_near_areas <- gtfssupplyindex:::stops_in_walk_dist(
  list_gtfs = list_gtfs, 
  areas_of_interest = areas_of_interest,
  EPSG_for_transform = 28355
)

```



## Public Transport Victoria (PTV)
Larger scale testing was performed using the Victorian GTFS feed, 
published by Public Transport Victoria (PTV), 
sourced via @transitfeeds_victoria:2023aa for historical feeds. 
Again, ABS data was used for the areas_of_interest. 




## Extensions?? 
Hourly
"Manhattan- and London-ised Indexes"


Tidytransit includes a sample GTFS feed from New York's MTA
(including the subway!), 
and so this was used for code tests were appropriate.

# Results
## Code structure and output
Developed code is available and documented on github [@gtfssupplyindex_github]. 
The structure of the package and the functions developed to generate each table are shown in Figure 2. This indicates how the package takes input from three files: a gtfs feed (gtfs.zip); a sf object describing the geometry of the areas for which the SI is to be calculated; and a csv file defining the buffer zone distances (in metres) for each route_type^[A version of this file is included in the package.]. 

```{r SI_ERD, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the data structure and functions related to the gtfssupplyindex package", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/SI_data_structure.png")

```

Various data tables are output by functions included in the package.  The ultimate output (Figure 2, bottom right) is a si_by_area_and_hour table, which reports the SI score for each hour of the day across dates specified by the user. 

## Mornington Penninsula results
This section shows outputs of the various functions for December 30th, 2018, for the Mornington Peninsula Tourist Railway GTFS feed. The ultimate results, showing the SI scores for each Hourly results are shown in Table 2.
