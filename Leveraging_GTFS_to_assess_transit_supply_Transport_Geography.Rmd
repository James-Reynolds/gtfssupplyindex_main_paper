# Introduction
Providing basic mobility 
for those who cannot otherwise drive 
is a key purpose for transit 
in many places [@Currie:2016aa].
Age, 
disability, 
socio-economic status, 
lack of a driver's license 
or vehicle, 
and many other factors 
might make someone
reliant on 
transit services 
for some or all of their travel. 
Approaches for identifying 
spatial gaps in transit supply,     
where is a high or very high social need 
yet little or no service, have 
been reported in previous research [@Currie2003Hobart; 
@Currie2004Gap;
@Currie2007Identifying; @currie2010identifying].

However, in the almost two decades since
there does not appear to have been much further use or development 
of these approach. 
As well, it is unclear if
the spatial patterns 
identified in this previous research 
are representative of 
transit supply and social need 
in other places,
or whether the location of gaps have changed in the intervening years.
This may in part be because 
at the time transit schedule data 
was not readily available in 
a consistent, electronic formats. 

Nowadays, however, 
more than 10,000 transit agencies 
publicly release schedule data 
in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)
format. 
Various tools for manipulating such datasets 
are also now available, 
including software for 
validating, 
analysing 
and visualizating GTFS, 
as well as a separate standard 
(GTFS-Realtime) for sharing 
live vehicle locations [@GTFS].

However, software tools
for examining spatial 
patterns and gaps 
in transit supply 
with respect to 
social needs for transport
appears limited.
This gap and the lack of 
direct follow up 
to @Currie2003Hobart, 
@Currie2004Gap, 
@Currie2007Identifying 
and @currie2010identifying 
provide the motivation 
for this paper.
The three main objectives of the research are: 
(1) to develop tools for undertaking needs-gap analysis 
using GTFS datasets; 
(2) to explore whether such gaps have changed in the intervening years; 
and (3) to better understand whether spatial patterns in 
Melbourne are representative of those in other places.

This research included 
the development of a new R package (gtfssupplyindex) 
with software tools 
that facilitate the 
use of the 
@Currie2003Hobart, 
@Currie2004Gap, 
@Currie2007Identifying 
and @currie2010identifying
approach, 
in particular the calculation of
transit Supply Index (SI) scores 
from GTFS datasets. 
Also presented in this paper 
are results for Australian cities in 2016 and 2021, 
matching the most recent censuses, 
which are compared across locations 
and to the 2006 analysis
of Melbourne reported in @currie2010identifying.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:
the next section outlines the background to this research. 
Section 3 describes the study methodology, 
followed by presentation of results in Section 4 
and discussion in Section 5. 
Limitations of this study, 
directions for future research and 
a brief conclusion are provided in Section 6. 

# Background
## Transit metrics
There are 
many metrics 
available for benchmarking transit services, 
including those in 
the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Report 88 guidebook 
on developing performance-measurement systems [@Ryus:2003aa]; 
and those
used across benchmarking databases and programs 
(e.g. @Florida-Transit-Information-System:2018aa, @UITP:2015aa @Imperial-College-London:2023aa;
The Fielding Triangle [@FieldingGordonJ1987Mpts] 
provides a framework 
for combining indicators of 
service inputs, 
outputs 
and consumption 
to describe cost efficiency, 
cost effectiveness and
service effectiveness. 
More broadly: @Litman:2003ab 
and @Litman:2016aa 
discuss some of the traffic, 
mobility, 
accessibility, 
social equity, 
strategic planning 
and other rational decision-making-based
perspectives underling transport indicators; 
@Reynolds:2017ah extends 
these into models of how 
institutionalism, 
incrementalism 
and other public policy analysis concepts 
might apply to decision-making processes 
relating to transit prioritization; 
@GuzmanLuisA.2017Aeit developed a measure of accessibility 
in the context of policy development 
and social equity 
for Latin American Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) networks; and 
@Creutzig2020streetspaceallocation
introduced street space allocation metrics 
based around ten ethical principles. 

However, 
many of these metrics 
may be difficult to calculate, 
explain or understand, 
especially for those who are not planners, engineers 
or other technical specialists. 
Where pre-calculated transit metrics 
are immediately available, 
such as on a website or 
other online platform, 
it may not be possible
to independently generate scores, 
for instance to assess proposed system changes. 
Contrasting examples are provided by the metrics in the 
Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM) 
and the Transit Score website [@WalkScore:2023tg]:

- Transit Scores are readily available online 
for locations with a published GTFS feed. 
The meaning of the metric
also appears easy to explain, 
with the highest possible score of 100 
representing the sort of transit accessibility 
experienced in the center of New York. 
However, 
the Transit Score algorithm 
is secret, 
and scores cannot be calculated independently
or generated 
for proposed changes to networks. 

- The TCQSM provides a wide range of metrics 
for measuring different aspects of a transit system. 
The TCQSM scores themselves appear easy to understand or explain, 
ranging from A (good) to F (bad), 
although the large number of metrics 
might be somewhat overwhelming for some users.
The scores, however, 
can be calculated independently, given sufficient data. 

The widespread availability of GTFS datasets 
in recent years has facilitated the development of tools, 
such as the Transit Score, 
that apply the same metric to many transit systems. 
@Wong:2013aa provides another example of what can be done 
with GTFS data, 
open metrics and coding,
by reporting the distribution of
various TCQSM metrics 
across 50 USA transit operators. 
Code used in the 
@Wong:2013aa analysis 
is available 
for those who might wish 
to produce a similar study 
for other locations and systems. 


## The Transit Suppy Index
An objective of this study is to 
produce code that 
facilitates calculation of the SI metric
from GTFS data. 
A generalized form of the SI equation, 
adapted from @currie2010identifying, 
is: 

  $$SI_{area, time} = \sum{\frac{Area_{Bn}}{Area_{area}}*SL_{n, time}}$$

where:

- $SI_{area, time}$ is the Supply Index for the area of interest 
and a given period of time;

- $Area_{Bn}$ is the buffer area for each stop (n) within the area of interest 
(in @currie2010identifying this was based on 
a radius of 400 metres for bus and tram stops, 
and 800 metres for railway stations);

- $Area_{area}$ is the area of the area of interest; and

- $SL_{n,time}$ is the number of transit arrivals for each stop 
for a given time period.

```{r Currie_map_SI, fig.cap = "Distribution of supply measure scores â€“ Metropolitan Melbourne (2006), Source: Currie (2010)",  echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

knitr::include_graphics("graphics/Currie2010SI.png")

```

@currie2010identifying reported SI scores 
for Census Collection Districts (CCDs) 
across Greater Melbourne in 2006, 
as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI}.  
They identified general patterns of
more transit supply 
in the middle and inner suburbs
and along passenger railway lines; and 
outer areas tending to have very low SI scores 
or no transit supply at all. 

## Social need and needs gap


```{r Currie_chart_gap, fig.cap = "Log supply score and need index values â€“ Melbourne needs-gap study, Source: Currie (2010)",  echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

#knitr::include_graphics("graphics/Currie2010chart.png")

```


```{r Currie_map_needs, fig.cap = "Distribution of categories of composite social need index scores in 2006, Source: Currie (2010)",  echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

knitr::include_graphics("graphics/Currie2010Needs.png")

```

As well as measuring transit supply, @currie2010identifying also 
assessed the social need for transit 
across Greater Melbourne using: 
the Australian Bureaus of Statistics' Index of Related Socio-Economic Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD) and 
a transport needs index derived 
from eight weighted indicators.
The spatial distribution of this 
composite social needs index in 2006, 
reproduced in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_needs), 
indicates areas of 
above average, 
high and
very high 
social needs 
in 2006 were located in: 
some outer areas, 
particularly in the east and south-east; 
and in some middle areas in the south-east,
north and west. 


```{r Currie_map_gap, fig.cap = "Melbourne needs-gap in 2006 â€“ very high transport need areas with zero or very low public transport supply, Source: Currie (2010)",  echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

knitr::include_graphics("graphics/Currie2010gap.png")

```
 

As the final step in the spatial needs-gap analysis, 
@currie2010identifying identified 
areas with very high transport needs, 
but very low or no transit supply,  
as reproduced in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_gap}. 
This indicated areas 
where service gaps might be of particular concern, 
Most of these were located in outer parts of Melbourne 
in the north-east, south-east and south, 
although there were also some pockets 
in the middle suburbs in the west, north and south east.
Overall, @currie2010identifying found that 
"8.2% of Melbourne residents have â€˜very highâ€™ needs 
but â€˜zeroâ€™, â€˜lowâ€™ or â€˜very lowâ€™ public transport supply."
Using this methodology in transit planning 
was also suggested as
"substantially more useful than the presentation of anecdotal evidence, 
which is the most common means 
of identifying transport needs 
in local transport studies throughout the world."[@currie2010identifying]

However, it does not appear that this approach 
has been widely adopted 
in practice 
or further developed by researchers. 
Our suspicion is that while the SI has a relatively simple formula 
and requires only geographic and timetable data, 
the lack of software tools 
may be partly why it has not been more widely adopted.

It is also unclear 
whether the patterns in Melbourne 
identified in @currie2010identifying 
have changed 
since the 2006 analysis, 
or if Melbourne is representative of other locations. 
Developing a software tool 
to calculate SI tools from GTFS data, 
and then using it to comparing current conditions and other locations 
to the findings of @currie2010identifying, 
therefore, provides the motivation 
for this research.


# Methodology
## Code development

This study developed
a package of tools 
for calculating the SI from GTFS data 
using the R programming language [@R-base].
The recommendations of @wickham2023r 
informed the package setup and 
development approach. 
Various existing packages 
and code examples
were relied upon including: 
the sf package [@R-sf] for geospatial analysis; 
the tidyverse [@tidyverse2019]; 
gtfstools [@R-gtfstools]; and 
tidytransit [@R-tidytransit]. 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data was also used, sourced via the strayr 
and absmapsdata packages [@r-strayr].

Code was developed and tested on 
the Mornington Peninsula Tourist Railway GTFS feed. 
This was selected primarily for convenience, 
given that the authors are familiar with 
the surrounding geography 
and that the feed covers 
a small number of trips across 
just three stations.  

## Changes since 2006: Greater Melbourne
Much has changed since 2006, 
including the spatial geography used by the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to collect census data. 
To allow direct comparison between 2006 and now, therefore, 
this study calculated SI scores 
using the same 
Census Collection Districts (CCDs) used by 
@currie2010identifying, 
but for the week starting the day of the 2021 census
The Victorian GTFS feed, 
published by Public Transport Victoria (PTV), 
was used, with historical feeds sourced via @transitfeeds_victoria:2023aa.

# This results in "Warning: Duplicated ids found in: stops The returned object is not a tidygtfs object, you can use as_tidygtfs() after fixing the issue."

#So, remove the duplicated stops 
#identify duplicate stops
ptv_210805_duplicated_stops <- tabyl(ptv_210805$stops$stop_id) %>% filter (n>1)
names(ptv_210805_duplicated_stops) <- c("stop_id", "n", "percent")

```


Unfortunately, it is not possible to obtain 
2016 or 2021 social disadvantage data for 
CCDs, as the ABS now releases data for SA zones only. 
SA1 zones, therefore, are adopted for the comparison of 
social needs-gaps in 2016 and 2021, 
as discussed in the following. 

## Variation in spatial patterns across location. 
SI scores were also calculated for 
Greater Melbourne, 
Greater Brisbane, 
Greater Perth, 
Greater Adelaide,
Greater Hobart and 
the Australian Capital Territory (which includes Canberra),
again for the week starting on the day of the 2021 census.
Historical GTFS data was again sourced via the Transit Feeds website, 
Unfortunately it was not possible to locate 
historical GTFS data for Greater Sydney 
or Greater Darwin, 
so instead the latest data sets were sourced directly 
from the relevant transit authorities. 


For comparison between cities, 
Statistical Area 1 (SA1) zones were adopted 
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics [@ABSmaps] 
as the areas of interest. 
This allowed direct comparison 
to ABS-reported values for social and 
transport needs, 
population 
and other census data.

## Measuring social disadvantage
This study adopts a similar approach to measuring social disadvantage 
as used in @currie2010identifying, using: 
the ABS' Index of Relative Socio-Economic Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD); and
a transport needs index^[The same need indicators and weightings used in @currie2010identifying were adopted, although
\$799 or lower per week was used
as the  threshold for low income households 
rather than \$499 
to account for inflation 
(as per Reserve Bank of Australia's online inflation calculator).].
A composite needs indicator was derived 
based on the IRSAD and the transport needs index, 
again as per the @currie2010identifying approach^[However, 
changes to the ABS reporting systems mean
that the composite needs indicator 
had to based on weighting both the IRSAD index and the transport need index 
by the total population of each SA1 zone, 
which were then added, standardised and split into six groups.].

# Results
## The gtfssupplyindex Package
Code developed to calculate SI scores 
is available as an R package on github (see @gtfssupplyindex_github).
Included in the package 
is a vignette that outlines 
the structure of the calculations, 
the developed functions (LINK HERE), 
and step-by-step calculations for the 
Mornington Peninsula Railway 
as a worked example 
and comparison to SI scores calculated manually.

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_CCD_2021} shows SI scores 
for Melbourne in the week of the 2021 census, 
using the same (2006) CCD boundaries as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI}.
Comparing Figures \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} 
and \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_CCD_2021} suggests: 

- Overall spatial patterns appear generally similar in 2021 as in 2006, with higher levels of transit supply in inner areas and close to most railway lines.
- There are still many areas with very low or zero transit supply, especially in outer areas. However, only `r si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>%  filter(transit_supply == "Zero Supply") %>% nrow()` CCDs have Zero Supply in 2021, compared to the 186 in 2006 reported in @currie2010identifying. 
- There are, however, slightly more CCDs included in this 2021 analysis (`r si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% nrow() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` compared to the 5,720 in 2006), meaning that the percentage of CCDs with Zero Supply has fallen to `r percent_format(accuracy = 0.01)((si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>%  filter(transit_supply == "Zero Supply") %>%  nrow()) / (si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% nrow()))` from the 3.25% in 2006. The average SI value has also increased to `r si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% select(SI) %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% unlist()%>% mean() %>% format(big.mark = ",", digits = 5)` from its value of 2,886.9 in 2006, indicating that the overall transit service supply score has increased by approximately `r percent_format(accuracy = 1)((si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% select(SI) %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% unlist() %>% mean() * si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% nrow()) / (2886.9 * 5839)-1)`.

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_CCD_2021_by_suburbs_SI_scores} compare SI scores for CCDs across the inner, middle and outer suburbs.

### 2021 SI scores - SA1s
The 2006 census was the last one that used CCDs, and population and other census data is now available from the ABS for SA1 zones instead. Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_SA1_2021_plot}(Appendix A) shows 2021 SI scores for Greater Melbourne, but using SA1 zones and the 2021 Greater Melbourne GCCSA boundary. Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_SA1_2021_table} and Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_SA1_2021_table} compare number of CCD and SA1 zones in each category in 2006 and 2021.

A smaller proportion of CCDs have Zero Supply in 2021 than 2006, suggesting that transit now covers more of city. However, Greater Melbourne now covers a larger spatial area than it did in 2006, and most of the new additions appear to have Zero or Very Low transit supply. Hence, looking at the overall picture for 2021 the proportion of SA1s with Zero Supply or with supply below the average is larger than was the case for CCDs in 2006.

Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_SA1_2021_table} and Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_population_figure} show that the proportion of the population in zones with Zero Supply was higher in 2021 than in 2006.  but a slightly larger share of the population are in zones with SI scores above the average. 

### 2021 Social needs
Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_social_needs} shows the distribution of categories of social need index scores across Greater Melbourne for 2021. This figure is analogous to the 2006 value from @currie2010identifying shown in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_needs} although, as discussed in the methodology section above, it was not possible to exactly replicate the @currie2010identifying approach due to changes in the way census results are reported.

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_social_needs} appears to indicate that there is no clear spatial pattern to the distribution of the categories of the composite need index scores. This appears to contrast to trend, albeit with some exceptions, towards very high social needs scores in outer areas identified by @currie2010identifying (Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_needs}). This may, however, be an artifact of either the differences in the composite needs scores used in this analysis (due to the lack of data to assess relative needs) compared to the @currie2010identifying analysis. As well, the 2021 census SA1 zones generally appear to smalller than the 2006 Census Collection Districts (CCDs) used in @currie2010identifying, especially in outer areas. This will be associated with the growth of Greater Melbourne's population and spatial dispersment, with many of the large outer 'Very High' CCDs shown in the 2006 map now split into many more SA1 zones.
