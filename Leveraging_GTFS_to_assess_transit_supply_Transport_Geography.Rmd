# Introduction
"If you can't measure it, you can't manage it" 
is often miss-attributed to @Deming1993new, 
who was trying to
make the opposite point [@Berenson2016in]. 
Regardless,
service level indicators 
are important in
researching, 
managing 
and seeking to improve transit operations 
[@FieldingGordonJ1987Mpts; @Ryus:2003aa]. 
Many indicators already exist 
including, for example: 
those in the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM)[@TCQSM:2013] and
the Transit Score metric [@WalkScore:2023tg].

However, practitioners, 
researchers 
and advocates 
using such metrics 
may face two inter-related challenges: 
(1) calculating the metrics themselves 
for a specific location 
and service pattern; and
(2) explaining the metrics, 
their meaning 
and importance 
to those who 
are not specialists in transit
For example:
the TCQSM metrics 
might be 
difficult to calculate 
without specialist software and data, 
but, they use an A to F scoring system 
and there is an entire guidebook 
explaining each;  
in contrast, 
entering an address into the Transit Score website 
will return a score out of 100 
reflecting the quantity of transit available, but 
the methodolgy and algorithm is 
not publicly available, 
so these cannot be calculated independently.


Previous research by @currie2007identifying 
developed a transit Supply Index (SI) 
that appears to be both 
relatively easy to calculate and 
explain to non-transport professionals. 
It is obtained by calculating 
the number of transit arrivals 
at each stop within an area of interest, 
with an adjustment made to account for 
the typical walking distance catchment 
of transit stops and stations. 
Higher SI scores indicate 
areas with higher frequency services 
and/or better coverage. 

Unfortunately, 
the SI does not appear to have been widely used,
perhaps in part because at the time it was first published 
timetable data was not publicly available 
in a standardized 
and machine-readable format. 
The scores reported in Currie and Senbergs (2007)
were calculated directly from a database of services 
provided by the transit authority 
in Melbourne, Australia. 
Since then, however, 
the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) 
has developed 
as a way to publish timetable data 
in a standardized format.  
More than 10,000 agencies 
are now providing GTFS feeds^[There are two forms: 
GTFS-static consisting of the timetable data (the scheduled services); 
and GTFS-realtime, which includes vehicle arrivals and departure times based on real-world position data. 
This paper and project uses only the GTFS-static (timetable) format.] 
[@GTFS], 
and many visualization, processing and analysis tools 
are now available. 

A gap, however, is that 
there is not yet a tool to calculate SI scores directly from 
GTFS datasets.
This provides the motivation 
for the research reported in this paper, 
in which a new R package (gtfssupplyindex) 
specifically developed to calculate SI scores 
is presented. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:
the next seciton outlines the background to this research,
including the original formulation of the Transit Supply Index, 
and an explanation of the GTFS. 
Section 3 then describes the study methodology, 
followed by a brief presentation of results in Section 4. 
Section 5 discusses the results, 
outlines directions for future research 
and provides a conclusion. 

# Background

## Transit metrics
Even a brief search reveals 
many metrics 
available for benchmarking transit services. 
Examples include: 
(1) those in the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Report 88, which is an extensive guidebook on developing a performance-measurement system [@Ryus:2003aa]; 
(2) online databases provided by 
the Florida Transit Information System (FTIS) [@Florida-Transit-Information-System:2018aa] 
and @UITP:2015aa; 
(3) those used in the extensive annual benchmarking program
undertaken yearly by the Transport Strategy Centre, 
which includes over 100 transit providers around the world [@Imperial-College-London:2023aa]; and
(4) a recently developed methodology to calculate 'blank spots' within an area, 
being those places beyond 400/800 metre walking distances to/from bus and tram stops/train stations [@AlamriSultan2023GAoA]. 
  
  
The Fielding Triangle [@FieldingGordonJ1987Mpts] provides a framework 
for understanding how such metrics combine 
service inputs, 
outputs 
and consumption.  
to describe cost efficiency 
and effectiveness; and
service effectiveness. 
At a larger scale, 
@Litman:2003ab 
and @Litman:2016aa 
discuss some of the traffic, 
mobility, 
accessibility, 
social equity, 
strategic planning 
and other rational decision-making-based
perspectives underling such transit metrics, 
while @Reynolds:2017ah extends 
these into models of how 
institutionalism, 
incrementalism 
and other public policy analysis concepts 
might apply to decision-making processes. 
Further examples include:
(1) @GuzmanLuisA.2017Aeit, 
who develop a measure of accessibility 
in the context of policy development 
and social equity 
for Latin American Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) networks; and 
(2) the street space allocation metrics 
based around 10 ethical principles 
introduced by @Creutzig2020streetspaceallocation. 

However, 
many of these metrics appear difficult to calculate, 
complex to explain or understand, 
and likely not well suited to communication 
with those who are not transit planners or engineers, 
or other technical specialists. 
Where pre-calculated metrics 
are immediately available 
it may not be possible for  practitioners, 
researchers 
or advocates 
to independently generate metrics 
for proposed system changes. 
Sometimes it is not even possible 
to know precisely how scores for the existing services levels are calculated. 

For example, 
Transit Scores 
for locations with a published GTFS feed 
are readily available on the @WalkScore:2023tg website, 
eliminating the need for any calculations. 
The meaning of these Transit Scores 
appears easy to explain, 
as the highest possible score of 100 
represents what might be experienced in the centre of New York. 
However, 
the Transit Score algorithm 
is patented 
and effectively a black box. 
It is not possible to calculate Transit Scores scores independently. 
Nor can Transit Scores to be generated 
for proposed changes to networks. 
The Transit Score metric, therefore, 
fails the first of the aforementioned challenges, 
as practitioners, researchers and advocates 
can only use those scores provided online.
The metric is simple to explain: 
the closer to 100, the better; but, 
because it is based on 
a patented algorithm it may not be easy to understand or explain 
the connection between real-world conditions 
and the Transit Score, 
or what might need to be done 
to improve the score (and service levels). 
As such, it might partially 
pass the second of the aforementioned challenges, 
as it is simple to understand, 
yet may not withstand scrutiny.  


In contrast, the TCQSM, 
specifies Levels of Service (LOS) 
between A and F 
across a range of factors^[
Including service span, 
frequency, 
speed, 
the proportion of the population serviced, 
competitiveness of travel times to car-based travel, 
and many more.]. 
This scoring scheme appears relatively simple to explain^[
A is good and F is bad.] and matches 
that often used in traffic capacity analysis. 
Detail within @TCQSM:2013 
provides a resource for anyone wanting to better understand what the scores mean. 
However, 
calculation of many of TCQSM metrics may need specialised software 
and datasets^[
For example, 
the Service Coverage Area metric in the TCQSM (pp. 5-8 to 5-21) 
may require GIS or other analysis, 
on top of accurate data about population densities, 
stop locations 
and service schedules.] 
and it might be challenging to explain 
the detail of these measures 
or how to improve them 
to non-technical decision-makers, 
stakeholders 
or others involved in transit management or advocacy. 

## GTFS
The introduction of the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) 
and widespread release of schedule data in this format, 
however, 
has helped towards making transit metrics more broadly available and usable. 
GTFS is an open, 
text-based format 
that was developed originally to allow transit information to be included in the Google Maps navigation platform [@GTFS]. 

```{r GTFS_ERD, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "GTFS entity relationship diagram. Source: adapted by author from Alamri et al (2023) and the GTFS Schedule Reference (16/11/2023 revision).", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/GTFS.png")

```

Figure 1 shows 
an Entity Relationship Diargram (ERD) 
of the GTFS data structure. 
Each box represents 
a database table 
in the GTFS, 
with table rows 
indicating the variables (columns) 
included in each^[
For example, 
each record in the 'stops' table 
includes a value for stop_id, 
stop_name, 
stop_lat and 
stop_lon.]. 
Relationships between the tables 
are indicated by the connecting lines, 
and Primary Key (PK) and Foreign Key (FK) designations^[
For example, 
stop_id appears in the 'stops' and 'stop_times' tables as a 
Primary Key and Foreign Key.]. 
`Crow's feet' 
indicate the relationships between each table^[
See https://i.stack.imgur.com/fxaAq.png for guide to the symbols. 
But, for example, 
the stops table is required, 
with the stop_id field providing a unique (primary) key 
for every stop. 
Within the stop_times table (which is also required) 
the stop_id field is a foreign key. 
Each unique stop_id 
can appear many times in the stop_times table, 
but can appear only once in the stops table. 
In the stop_times table 
each combination of 
trip_id, 
stop_id and 
arrival time 
must be unique (although see note 2!) 
meaning that these fields 
together represent a composite key.].


GTFS now provides a mechanism 
for including individual transit systems 
in many online products and analysis, 
including the Transit Score metric itself. 
@Wong:2013aa provides another example of what can be done with GTFS data, 
having developed code to calculate of some of the TCQSM metrics^[
Daily average headways, 
route length 
and stop numbers.] 
for 50 transit operators.
While the @Wong:2013aa open-source code is readily available^[
https://github.com/jcwong86/GTFS_Explore_Tool] 
this is now 11 years old 
and does not appear to be currently maintained. 
Future research may involve 
reviewing this code 
and using it to analyse modern GTFS feeds. 
However, 
in this paper the aim is more modest, 
being to use GTFS data to calculate Currie and Senbergs' (2007) SI.   


## The Transit Suppy Index
A generalized form of the Transit Supply Index (SI) is shown in Equation 1^[
Currie and Senbergs' (2007) focus 
was the context of Melbourne's Census Collection Districts (CCD) 
and calculations based on a week of transit service. 
CCDs predate the introduction of 
Statistical Areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 (SA1, SA2, SA3, SA4), 
and other geographical divisions 
currently used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 
which may be more familiar to readers from down under.]. 

  $$SI_{area, time} = \sum{\frac{Area_{Bn}}{Area_{area}}*SL_{n, time}}$$
 In Equation 1:
 
(1) $SI_{area, time}$ is the Supply Index for the area of interest 
and a given period of time;
(2) $Area_{Bn}$ is the buffer area for each stop (n) within the area of interest. 
In Currie and Senbergs (2007) this was based on 
a radius of 400 metres for bus and tram stops, 
and 800 metres for railway stations;
(3) $Area_{area}$ is the area of the area of interest; and
(4) $SL_{n,time}$ is the number of transit arrivals for each stop 
for a given time period.

An advantage of the SI is 
that it is a relatively simple number 
to calculate, 
understand 
and explain. 
It describes 
the number of transit arrivals 
at stops within 
an area of interest 
and time frame, 
multiplied by a factor 
accounting for the proportion of the area of interest 
within typical walking distances of each stop. 
Hence, 
more services, 
more stops 
and higher frequencies 
increase the score. 
However, the SI does not incorporate 
service span, 
speed 
or other elements of a transit service. 
While these may be important 
to passenger experience, 
they might add considerable complexity. 

Simplicity is also helped 
by the way 
that the SI is additive, 
in that $SI_{area, time}$ scores can be aggregated 
to calculate an overall score 
across multiple time periods 
or for a region encompassing multiple areas of interest. 


# Methodology
This study 
developed a package 
with tools for calculating the SI from GTFS data. 
R [@R-base], 
a widely used and readily available statistical programming language, 
was adopted for code development. 
The package development setup and workflow described by @wickham2023r 
was adopted in this study. 
Various existing packages 
were relied upon including: 
the sf package [@R-sf] for geospatial analysis; 
the tidyverse [@tidyverse2019]; 
gtfstools [@R-gtfstools]; and 
tidytransit [@R-tidytransit]. 
Some code was adapted from 
examples, vignettes and other documentation 
in the tidytransit, gtfstools and other packages.

Two cases where used during the code development and testing 
such that results might be generated for real GTFS data.  
These cases were the Mornington Peninsula Tourist Railway GTFS feed 
and the Public Transport Victoria (PTV) GTFS feed, 
both in Victoria, Australia. 
Both were selected primarily for convenience, 
given that the authors are familiar with 
the typical service patterns and geography.
Further cases were selected as 
leading, 
representative 
and contrasting examples 
for the results reported here. 


## Mornington Penninsula Tourist Railway

The Morning Peninsula Tourist Railway 
is located in the outer south-eastern suburbs of Greater Melbourne. 
It runs on Sundays and Wednesdays 
between Mornington (southwestern-most station) 
and Moorooduc, with an intermediate stop at Tanti Park^[https://transitfeeds.com/p/mornington-railway/806/latest/stops]. 
A GTFS feed from 2018 
was selected for the purposes of tests and demonstrating the code and output.
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data was also used, 
primarily through the strayr 
and absmapsdata packages [@r-strayr].
The Mornington Peninsular Statistical Area 3 (SA3) zone 
and the Statistical Area 1 (SA1) zones contained within it 
were adopted as the areas of interest. 
These are shown in Figure 2, 
together with the locations of the three railway stations.  

```{r mornington_map_SA3, fig.cap = "Mornington Penninsula SA1 zones and location of Mornington Tourist Railway Stations.", fig.width = 3, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

  "gtfs.zip", 
  package = "gtfssupplyindex", 
  mustWork = TRUE))

  tidytransit::stops_as_sf()

stops_in_or_near_areas <- gtfssupplyindex:::stops_in_walk_dist(
  list_gtfs = list_gtfs, 
  areas_of_interest = areas_of_interest,
  EPSG_for_transform = 28355
)

```

```{r mornington_map_ABS, fig.width = 3, fig.height= 3, fig.cap = "SA1 zones and location of Mornington Tourist Railway Stations.",  echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("graphics/mornington.png")

```

## Public Transport Victoria (PTV)
Larger scale testing was performed using the Victorian GTFS feed, 
published by Public Transport Victoria (PTV), 
sourced via @transitfeeds_victoria:2023aa for historical feeds. 
Again, ABS data was used for the areas of interest. 


## Extensions?? 
Hourly
"Manhattan- and London-ised Indexes"


Tidytransit includes a sample GTFS feed from New York's MTA
(including the subway!), 
and so this was used for code tests were appropriate.

# Results
## Code structure and output
Developed code is available and documented on github [@gtfssupplyindex_github]. 
The structure of the package 
and the functions developed 
to generate each table are shown in Figure 2. 
This indicates how the package takes input from three files: 
a gtfs feed (gtfs.zip); 
a sf object describing the geometry of the areas 
for which the SI is to be calculated; and 
a csv file defining the buffer zone distances (in metres) 
for each route type^[This file is included in the package.]. 

```{r SI_ERD, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap = "Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the data structure and functions related to the gtfssupplyindex package", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/SI_data_structure.png")

```

The ultimate output 
is a si_by_area_and_hour table 
(Figure 2, bottom right), 
which reports the SI score for each hour of the day 
across dates specified by the user. 
The various functions and their output 
and explained in the following, 
using the Mornington Penninsula GTFS 
as an example.

## Mornington Penninsula results
Outputs of the various functions 
are shown in the following 
for December 30th, 2018. 
The ultimate output,

        axis.ticks.y=element_blank()  #remove y axis ticks
  )



```

The results meet expectations, with higher scores for SA1 zones closer to the three stations. To confirm the calculation by hand selecting SA1 21402138128, which is close to the Mornington Station, is relatively trivial. By inspection, all of SA1 21402138128 is within an 800 metre walking distance of Mornington Station, meaning that $Area_{Bn} / Area_{area} = 1$.  The SI scores for each hour are therefore equal to the number of arrivals in each hour.  Table ?? shows the scores calculated by the funtion, which matches the pattern of arrivals shown in Figure ??

```{r mornington_hand_check, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

## Step-by-step: Mornington Peninsula

This section briefly describes the individual steps involved in using the gtfssupplyindex package.  These are (1) loading the gtfs.zip file; (2) loading geometry information about the areas of interested; (3) calculating which stops are within the catchment walking distance of which areas; and (4) calculating SI scores for a given time period or, as above, for all hours on a specific day. 

### 1. gtfs_by_route_type function

GTFS data is first loaded, with the gtfs_by_route_type function splitting this into a list (by route_type) of tidygtfs objects. This is achieved using the filter_by_route_type function from the gtfstools package [@filter_GTFS_by_mode].

```{r load_mornington_GTFS data, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
#load the revised mornington GTFS data
list_gtfs = gtfssupplyindex:::gtfs_by_route_type(system.file(
  "extdata/mornington180109",
  "gtfs.zip", 
  package = "gtfssupplyindex", 
  mustWork = TRUE))

```


### 2. load_areas_of_interest function


Geographical data about the areas of interest are loaded by the load_areas_of_interest.R function into an sf object, using the sf [@R-sf] package. The resultant areas_of_interest table contains each area_id and its associated geometry.   

```{r load_ABS data, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
areas_of_interest <- load_areas_of_interest(areas_of_interest = sf::st_read(system.file(
  "extdata",
  "mornington_sa12021.geojson", 
  package = "gtfssupplyindex", 
  mustWork = TRUE)), 
  area_id_field = "sa1_code_2021")
head(areas_of_interest) %>% kable(caption = "First 6 entries in areas_of_interest table")

```

Data about buffer zones, specifically the walking distance threshold assigned to each route_type (mode) is then loaded, again through a function (load_buffer_zone.R). The package includes this information in a csv file, in which it is assumed that the buffer zone is definied in metres. 

```{r load_buffer_distance_data, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
buffer_distance <- gtfssupplyindex:::load_buffer_zones()
head(buffer_distance) %>% kable(caption = "First six entries in buffer_distance definitions")
```

### 3. stops_in_walk_dist function

The stops_in_walk_dist function then generates a list (by route_type) in which each element is a datea table describing which stops are within walking distance of which areas of interest. Each table entry includes a stop_id, an area_id that is within the buffer_distance threshold of that stop, and the corresponding area related terms in the SI calculation^[This is the $Area_{Bn} / Area_{Area}$ bit]. 

```{r calculate_stop_in_or_near_areas, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
stops_in_or_near_areas <- gtfssupplyindex:::stops_in_walk_dist(
  list_gtfs = list_gtfs, 
  areas_of_interest = areas_of_interest,
  EPSG_for_transform = 28355, 
  verbose = FALSE
)

head(stops_in_or_near_areas[[1]]) %>% kable(caption = "'Rail' element of the stops_in_or_near_areas list for the Mornington Pennisula datasets, first six entries")
```

The variables passed to the stop_in_or_near_areas function are list_gtfs^[The list of tidygtfs objects ouput by the gtfs_by_route_type function], the areas_of_interest table^[Which is the output of the load_areas_of_interest function], the buffer_distance table^[Output by the load_buffer_zones function], and an EPSG_for_transform variable. This last variable is the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) value relevant to the geographic location. It is used to project the latitude and longitude values included in the GTFS data and area_of_interest data into metres, in this case relating to the GDA94 / MGA zone 55 relevant to Australia^[https://epsg.io/28355].  

The stops_in_walk_dist function is complicated by the need to have different buffer distances for each route_type, and to only include those parts of the walking catchment that are within each area of interest. It is structured as follows:  

(1) The first part of the stops_in_walk_dist function looks up the buffer_distance_length specific to each route_type in the list (by route_type) of tidygtfs objects. This value is appended to each tidygtfs object as an additional element (named buffer_distance). 

(2) Next the areas_of interest are transformed from latitude and longitude into metres, and the area is calculated. 

(3) The stops_in_walking_distance function then applies a sub-function, stops_in_walk_dist_one_route, to the list_gtfs (list of tidygtfs objects), in which: 

(4) A list of stops is extracted from the tidygtfs, using the stops_as_sf function from @R-tidytransit. 

(5) Circles are then drawn around each stop, with the radius equal to the buffer distance.  Intersecting these circles with the areas_of_interest then outputs an sf showing the catchment of each stop within each area of interest

(6) Finally, the $area_{Bn}$ terms are calculated for each combination of stop_id and area_id, 

The stops_in_walk_dist function includes a mode with output printed at each intermediate step (verbose = TRUE). The below shows the Morington Penninsula railway calculations again (as per the previous table), but run with verbose = TRUE so that intermediate steps are printed.  


```{r calculate_stop_in_or_near_areas_verbose, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%', fig.cap= c( "Step 5, circles around each stop, showing the intersections with the areas_of_interest, all stops", "as above, but from each stop individually")}
stops_in_or_near_areas <- gtfssupplyindex:::stops_in_walk_dist(
  list_gtfs = list_gtfs, 
  areas_of_interest = areas_of_interest,
  EPSG_for_transform = 28355, 
  verbose = TRUE
)

```


### 4. Calculating stop arrivals and the SI, SI_total and hourly


The si_calc.R function takes the stops_in_or_near_areas list (by route_type) of dataframes and the list_gtfs list (by route_type) of tidygtfs objects and calculates the si_by_route_type^[Which, again, is a list (by route_type) of dataframes, each containing a record for each area_id and combination of date, start_time and end_time specified by the user, and the corresponding (calculated) SI value.]

The tidytransit package includes an article about generating a departure timetable from a gtfs dataset [@tidytransit_departure_timetable]. Code from that article was adapted from this example to create functions to calculate the number of departures and arrivals from (a vector of) stop_ids within a given time period. These functions are included in the package^[See departures_and_arrivals.R] and called by the si_calc function^[Although this is not shown on the ERD].  Output from the arrivals function is shown in the bellow table. 

```{r arrivals_mornington_20181230, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

stop_ids <- list_gtfs[[1]]$stops %>%
 dplyr::select(stop_id)

arrivals_by_stop_id <- gtfssupplyindex::arrivals(
 gtfs = list_gtfs[[1]],
 stop_ids = stop_ids,
 date_ymd = "2018-12-30",
 start_hms = lubridate::hms("10:30:00"),
 end_hms = lubridate::hms("16:00:00")
)

arrivals_by_stop_id %>% kable(caption = "Arrivals at each stop for Sunday December 30th 2018, Mornington Peninsula tourist railway.")

```
This matches the number of trips shown in the Mornington Railway GTFS feed, being 4 in each direction^[https://transitfeeds.com/p/mornington-railway/806/latest/stop/1388695887/20181230]. 

```{r SI_Mornington_arrivals, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 2, fig.margin = FALSE, fig.cap = "Arrivals at Mornington Station (stop_id 1388695887) for 30/12/2018", echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/1388695887_inbound.png")

```

All the inputs to calculate the si are now available. Hence, the SI.calc function can be run, resulting in the si_by_route_type list (by route_type) of tables showing the area_id corresponding SI values

```{r SI_mornington_20181230, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
####-----first load all the inputs

#load the revised mornington GTFS data
list_gtfs = gtfssupplyindex:::gtfs_by_route_type(system.file(
  "extdata/mornington180109",
  "gtfs.zip", 
  package = "gtfssupplyindex", 
  mustWork = TRUE))

areas_of_interest <- load_areas_of_interest(absmapsdata::sa22021 %>% filter(sa3_name_2021 == "Mornington Peninsula") %>% select(sa2_code_2021),  area_id_field = "sa2_code_2021")

buffer_distance <- gtfssupplyindex:::load_buffer_zones()

stops_in_or_near_areas <- gtfssupplyindex:::stops_in_walk_dist(
  list_gtfs = list_gtfs, 
  areas_of_interest = areas_of_interest,
  EPSG_for_transform = 28355,
  verbose = FALSE
)

####----run SI.calc function to build si_by_mode_and_time list (by route_type) of tables

si_by_route_type <- si_calc(
    list_gtfs = list_gtfs,
    stops_in_or_near_areas = stops_in_or_near_areas, 
    date_ymd = lubridate::ymd("2018-12-30"), 
    start_hms = lubridate::hms("10:30:00"),
    end_hms = lubridate::hms("16:00:00"),
    verbose = TRUE)

si_by_route_type %>% kable(caption = "SI values for Mornington Penninsula Railway services on 30/12/2018 (full day)")

```

The si_total function aggregates the si_by_route_type tables so that values are no longer separated by mode. Although in the case of the Mornington Penninsula Railway there is only one route_type.  

Finally, the hourly function runs the si_calc and si_total functions for every hour in a single day. It outputs a table showing the SI scores for each area for each hour of the day^[Across the service span]. The below table shows this output, together with row and column totals.  

```{r SI_hourly_mornington_20181230, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

si_by_area_and_hour_wider <- hourly(list_gtfs, stops_in_or_near_areas, "2018-12-30")

si_by_area_and_hour_wider %>% adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) %>% kable(caption = "Mornington Penninsula Tourist Railway hourly SI values for December 30, 2018, for SA1 zones")

```
