abstract = {Most transportation agencies stipulate that an important planning goal is to provide equitable and just public transport services. However, who is to be served and the type of service that should be provided has been ambiguous. This paper develops a methodology for examining equity in the provision of public transportation services. An approach for identifying areas in need of public transport is developed based upon the use of socio-demographic and economic information. Public transport need is then related to levels of access to service. This approach makes it possible to establish the degree to which public transport services may be considered equitable in relation to need and suitable access. A detailed analysis of the southeast Queensland region of Australia illustrates how this approach may be used to inform public transport decision making. Copyright 2001 Blackwell Publishers},

abstract = {Accessibility indexing is important in evaluating existing land use patterns and transportation services, predicting travel demands and allocating transportation investments. A GIS-based land use and public transport accessibility indexing model has been developed for measuring and mapping levels of accessibility to basic community services by walking and/or public transport, within local government areas. The model aims to assist the planning and decision making process to deliver integrated land use and transportation outcomes. It is an origin-based accessibility model that determines levels of accessibility by utilising GIS analysis techniques to measures accessibility based on both actual walking distances and public transport travel time. The model has been applied to two pilot studies in the Gold Coast City to assess its practicality and effectiveness. This paper outlines the methodology of the model and the findings related to these pilot studies. The paper also demonstrates benefits and application of the model to other urbanised local government areas.},

abstract = {Transport affordability stresses have been acknowledged as a principle concern of transport disadvantage in Australian cities. Transport poverty is a term which has been used to describe low income households who have a little choice but to purchase and use cars to maintain a reasonable lifestyle in mainly fringe urban locations with no transport alternatives and poor walk accessibility. These households have been said to demonstrate lforced car ownershipr (FCO) however evidence suggest the degree of coercion involved is low, but affordability stresses which result are high. Forced car ownership has not been systematically reviewed since the 2001 census. This paper explores the extent to which FCO has changed between the 2001 and the most recent 2011 census. The analysis shows a 93 per cent increase in FCO households in outer Melbourne between 2001 and 2011. Most increases have been in areas with poor access to public transport or walk accessibility alternatives. Highest growth rates have occurred in outer western, northern and south-eastern fringe and middle Melbourne. The most pressing policy implication of these changes is that a greater proportion of low income Melbourne residents are vulnerable to financial shocks associated with potential future increases in fuel prices. The obvious implication of this analysis is that fringe Melbourne is facing a potential transport poverty crisis.},

Instead, when transport service provision and social disadvantage were considered in tandem, the research found that the disadvantaged groups living in areas with limited transport services are disproportionately represented in Western Sydney.

This study detailed an indexing model for accessibility of transit need and focused on the necessity of evaluating transit needs and transit accessibility simultaneously. A need index was developed to identify areas in high need of public transit services from economic and sociodemographic information, and a composite accessibility index was developed to identify levels of access to transit services and shortcomings in providing service. The need for transit service was then modeled as the lack of transit accessibility, and the model correlated different access indicators with their ability to predict transit service need. This model mapped areas with different levels of transit accessibility and transit needs by using a single score, which may be easily interpreted by planners who examine transit equity. The model was applied to the city of Meriden, Connecticut, and results were compared with a general approach for consistency and effectiveness. The usefulness of the model was also highlighted through a representative example of the model's application.},

It describes how the approach has been developed and applied using Hobart Tasmania as a study area. The approach aims to identify gaps in the public transport network where travel needs are high but services are poor or non-existent. It involves the use of readily available socio-economic statistics to quantify the distribution of needs in the community. A public transport network model identifies the quality of service offered by the public transport system to these groups and a Geographical Information Systems approach is used to display the distribution of gaps between service and needs which are identified. The technique is highly relevant for cities where the justification of public transport subsidies is largely social needs based, that is where congestion and environmental benefits of transit are less critical.

abstract = {Accessibility is a concept that is not entirely easy to define. Gould (1969) once stated that it is a ‘slippery notion … one of those common terms that everyone uses until faced with the problem of defining and measuring it’. Considerable research over the last 40 years has been devoted to defining and measuring accessibility, ranging from access to jobs within an hour's travel time to the ease at which given places can be reached. This article is concerned with the measurement of access provided by transit. It includes a review of past work on measuring accessibility in general and with respect to transit services in particular. From this overview of the literature, it can be seen that current methods fall short in measuring transit service access in several meaningful aspects. Based on this review and critique, we propose new refinements that can be used to help overcome some of these shortcomings. As a part of this, we define an extended GIS data structure to handle temporal elements of transit service. To demonstrate the value of these new measures, examples are presented with respect to mapping accessibility of transit services in Santa Barbara, California. Finally, we show how these measures can be used to develop a framework for supporting transit service analysis and planning.},

abstract = {Ex ante evaluations of transport policy options (including infrastructure plans) are generally based on cost-benefit analyses (CBA). Accessibility changes are included in such analyses indirectly, via a utilitarian perspective. But accessibility is broader than is assumed by this perspective and also incorporates equity and related distribution effects as well as social exclusion. This paper aims to give an overview of the relevance of distribution effects and equity, and social exclusion for accessibility, based on the literature. The most important conclusions of our paper is that the two subjects are poorly addressed in transport appraisal in general, and in CBA in particular. Additional ethical theories could add value to the utilitarian perspective, egalitarian theories being a major competitor. Equity analysis is however complex because there are several types of equity, various ways to categorize people for equity analysis, numerous impacts to consider, and various ways of measuring these impacts. And such analysis requires normative judgements, in addition to simply presenting distribution effects. Several options are available to express distribution effects. Important choices to be made if such effects need to be reported relate to the unit of comparison (e.g. the household versus the individual), the indicator to be used, and the value of each unit to be compared (e.g. accessibility) for all units of comparison (e.g. households). We also conclude that CBA is not suitable for evaluating social exclusion policies.

abstract = {A new approach to assessing the performance of public transport in meeting the needs of transport-disadvantaged people in the community is described. It reviews previous and current research in this area and describes how a new approach has been developed and applied with Hobart, Australia, as a study area. The approach aims to identify geographical gaps in public transport provision where travel needs are high but services are poor or nonexistent. It involves the use of readily available socioeconomic statistics to quantify the distribution of needs in the community with a single transport needs index. A public transport network model measures the public transport accessibility to these groups and a geographical information systems approach is used to display the distribution of the identified gaps between service and needs. The technique is highly relevant for smaller urban centers where the justification of public transport subsidies is largely social-needs-based—that is, where congestion and environmental benefits of transit are less critical. It is also relevant to recent work in transport accessibility audits and in the assessment of community impacts of alternative transit development strategies.},

abstract = {This paper defines and describes the concept of transportation equity. Transportation gives people the opportunity to access goods, activities and services that provide benefits, and also helps determine where people can live, work, shop, or go to school. Transportation is about opportunity, and opportunity affects equity. Three types of equity are described: horizontal equity (fairness); vertical equity with regard to social class and income; and vertical equity with regard to mobility need and ability. Ways that fairness can be better incorporated into transportation decisions are suggested. Automobile user charges, transit funding and traffic management are discussed in reference to how specific decisions can have equity implications.},

The project is part of a wider international research program funded by the Australian Research Council which is currently focusing on understanding transport disadvantage in Metropolitan Melbourne. The aim of the research is to explore the concept of forced car ownership as it might apply to urban Melbourne. The paper explores the relationship between income, location, car ownership, accessibility and public transport supply. It also explores car related expenditure and income and the travel behaviours of low income residents who have zero cars and those who might be considered to have forced car ownership.

abstract = {ABSTRACT The purpose of this research is to develop a methodology for calculating the index of the spatial equity for the public transportation services for the city of Seoul using the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient based on accessibility to the services. The index was estimated for 100 m × 100 m cells first and then aggregated for 424 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in the city. The indices for Seoul’s subway and bus were represented with and without the weighting factor. On the basis of this methodology, this study assessed the effect of an additional subway line on the spatial equity before and after its operation. Furthermore, an index of relative difference indicating the change in population and employment in the station areas was applied to investigate the changed effects of spatial equity between population and employment from the new subway line. The core findings from this research are summarized as follows. First, the subway network of Seoul provides more unequal public transportation services for the TAZs than for the bus network. Second, an improvement in the operation frequency of both transit modes would deepen the spatial inequity of Seoul. Third, a subway extension plan for Seoul could noticeably reduce the spatial inequity. The plan would improve the spatial equity for the population more than that for employment. The most important meaning of this study is to be found in combining spatial equity on the supply side with transit-oriented development (TOD) on the demand side. So, by establishing a TOD policy for the additional subway station areas, an appropriate land-use pattern can be established for maximizing potential ridership in consideration of the combination.},
