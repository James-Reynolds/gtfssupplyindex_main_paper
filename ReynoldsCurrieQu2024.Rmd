# Introduction
An important role for transit in many locations is to provide at least a basic level of 
service, so that those who cannot otherwise drive themselves have at least some mobility and accessibility 
to activities and service beyond walking distance [@Currie:2016aa].
There is evidence that a lower proportion of younger people are obtaining a 
driving license than was the case previously [@delbosc2013causes].
As well, age, 
disability, 
socio-economic status, 
lack of a vehicle or many other factors 
might make someone
reliant on 
transit for some or all of their travel. 
Vertical social-equity perspectives on transport policy-making, 
relating to supporting those who are disadvantaged 
(c.f. @Litman:2016aa), 
might therefore suggest providing at least some transit, 
and probably more than just a minimum, 
where there are higher social needs for transport.

@Currie2003Hobart, 
@Currie2004Gap; @Currie2007Identifying and @currie2010identifying 
developed an approach for identifying 
spatial gaps in transit supply related to social needs for transport, and 
applied it to a case study of Melbourne in 2006. 
This was suggested as being 
"substantially more useful than the presentation of anecdotal evidence, 
which is the most common means 
of identifying transport needs 
in local transport studies throughout the world" [@currie2010identifying].
However, there does not appear to have been 
much further use or development 
of this spatial analysis technique. 
It is unclear whether
the geographic patterns 
identified in this previous research
are representative of 
transit supply and social needs 
in other places,
or if the situation in Melbourne has changed in the intervening years.
This may in part be because until recently schedules 
was not typically available in 
consistent and electronic formats, 
meaning that assessing transit supply was a 
large task requiring bespoke sourcing, 
cleaning and analysis of data for each transit operator. 

Nowadays, however,
more than 10,000 transit agencies 
publicly release timetable data 
in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)
format [@GTFS]. 
Such standardisation allows Google Maps and 
other online platforms to provide transit-related outputs 
for any place publishing a feed. 
It also facilitates data access and processing for research purporses. 
However, tools
for using GTFS data 
to examine spatial 
patterns and gaps 
in transit supply 
with respect to 
social needs for transport
do not appear to be readily available.
This gap, and the lack of 
direct follow up 
to @Currie2003Hobart, 
@Currie2004Gap, 
@Currie2007Identifying 
and @currie2010identifying, 
provide motivation 
for this research.

The objectives of this research are: 
(1) to develop tools for undertaking needs-gap analysis 
using GTFS datasets; and 
(2) to explore whether the spatial pattern of gaps reported in @Currie2007Identifying 
and @currie2010identifying are consistent with current patterns. 
Research outcomes that are reported in this paper include 
the development of a new R package (gtfssupplyindex) 
that includes software tools 
for using the 
@Currie2007Identifying 
and @currie2010identifying
analysis approach, 
in particular the calculation of
transit Supply Index (SI) scores 
from GTFS datasets. 
Also presented in this paper 
are results for Melbourne in 2016 and 2021, 
matching the most recent censuses, 
for comparison to the 2006 results reported in @currie2010identifying^[The wider programme of research includes examination of spatial gaps in other cities, so as to better understand whether patterns in Melbourne are representative of other places. However, this paper is limited to examining Melbourne in 2016 and 2021 only. Results for other cities will be reported elsewhere.].

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:
the next section outlines the research context. 
Section 3 describes the study methodology, 
followed by presentation of results in Section 4 
and discussion in Section 5. 
Limitations of this study and directions for future research are discussed in Section 6, which concludes the paper. 

# Research context
There are 
many metrics 
available for assessing transit services. Examples include: those in 
the *Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Report 88: a guidebook 
for developing performance-measurement systems* [@Ryus:2003aa]; 
and those
used across benchmarking databases and programs such as by @Florida-Transit-Information-System:2018aa, the @UITP:2015aa and @Imperial-College-London:2023aa.
The Fielding Triangle [@FieldingGordonJ1987Mpts] 
provides a framework 
for combining indicators of 
service inputs, 
outputs 
and consumption 
to describe cost efficiency, 
cost effectiveness and
service effectiveness. 
More broadly: @Litman:2003ab 
and @Litman:2016aa 
discuss some of the traffic, 
mobility, 
accessibility, 
social equity, 
strategic planning 
and other rational decision-making
perspectives underlying many transport indicators; 
@Reynolds:2017ah extends 
these into models of how 
institutionalism, 
incrementalism 
and other public policy analysis concepts 
might apply to decision-making processes 
relating to transit prioritisation; 
@GuzmanLuisA.2017Aeit developed a measure of accessibility 
in the context of policy development 
and social equity 
for Latin American Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) networks; and 
@Creutzig2020streetspaceallocation
introduced street space allocation metrics 
based around ten ethical principles. 

Many such metrics, however,
may be difficult to calculate, 
explain or understand, 
especially for those who are not planners, engineers 
or other technical specialists. 
Where pre-calculated transit metrics 
are immediately available, 
such as on a website, 
it may not be possible
to independently generate scores and assess proposed system changes. 
Contrasting examples are provided by:

- *Transit Scores* [@WalkScore:2023tg], which 
are readily available online 
for locations with a published GTFS feed. 
The meaning of the metric
appears easy to explain, 
with the highest possible score of 100 
representing the sort of transit accessibility 
experienced in the center of New York. 
However, 
the algorithm 
is secret, 
and scores cannot be calculated independently. 

- The *Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM)*,
which provides a wide range of metrics 
for measuring different aspects of a transit system. 
The scores themselves appear easy to understand or explain, 
ranging from A (good) to F (bad), but 
there are many metrics,  
which may add to the complexity of using these 
in practice for communication with non-technical audiences 
(e.g. the public, politicians or other stakeholders).
TCQSM scores, however, 
can be calculated independently, given sufficient data. 

The widespread availability of GTFS datasets 
in recent years has facilitated the development of tools
that apply one or a group of metrics to many transit systems. 
The *Transit Score* website provides one example. 
@Wong:2013aa provides another in
reporting the distribution of
various TCQSM metrics 
across 50 USA transit operators. 
Code used in the 
@Wong:2013aa analysis 
is available 
for those who might wish 
to produce similar analysis 
for other locations or time periods. 
Developing a similar code base 
for calculating metrics associated with 
spatial gaps in transit supply with respect to social needs 
is an objective of the research reported in this paper. 

## The Transit Suppy Index
A generalized form of the SI equation, 
adapted from @currie2010identifying, 
is: 

  $$SI_{area, time} = \sum{\frac{Area_{Bn}}{Area_{area}}SL_{n, time}}$$

where:

- $SI_{area, time}$ is the Supply Index for the area of interest 
and a given period of time;

- $Area_{Bn}$ is the buffer area for each stop (n) within the area of interest 
(in @currie2010identifying this was based on 
a radius of 400 metres for bus and tram stops, 
and 800 metres for railway stations);

- $Area_{area}$ is the area of the area of interest; and

- $SL_{n,time}$ is the number of transit arrivals for each stop 
for a given time period.

Source: Currie (2010)", fig.subcap = c("Distribution of Transport Supply", "Distibution of Social Need for Transport", "Supply Index and Composite Needs Index scores", "CCDs with Very High needs and Very Low or Zero supply"),  echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("graphics/Currie2010gap.png")
```

@currie2010identifying reported SI scores 
for Census Collection Districts (CCDs) 
across Melbourne in 2006.
These were used to categorise service levels into seven groups, as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} (top).
General patterns were identified, being:
more transit supply 
in the inner and middle suburbs,
and along passenger railway lines; and 
outer areas tending to have very low SI scores 
or no transit supply at all. 

## Social need and needs-gap
As well as measuring transit supply, @currie2010identifying 
assessed the social need for transport 
across Melbourne using a composite index including: 
the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS') Index of Related Socio-Economic Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD) and 
a transport needs index derived 
from eight weighted indicators. The spatial distribution of this 
composite social needs index, 
reproduced in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} (middle), 
showed that areas of 
above average, 
high and
very high 
social needs 
in 2006 were located in: 
some outer areas, 
particularly in the east and south-east; 
and in some middle areas in the south-east,
north and west.

As the final step in the spatial needs-gap analysis, 
@currie2010identifying identified 
areas with very high transport needs, 
but very low or zero transit supply,
as reproduced in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} (bottom). 
These areas were identified as being those where service gaps 
might be of particular concern. 
Most of these were located in outer parts of Melbourne 
in the north-east, south-east and south, 
although there were also some pockets 
in the middle suburbs in the west, north and south east.
Overall, @currie2010identifying found that 
"8.2% of Melbourne residents have ‘very high’ needs 
but ‘zero’, ‘low’ or ‘very low’ public transport supply."

However, it does not appear that this approach 
has been widely adopted 
in practice or by researchers. 
Our suspicion is that while the SI has a relatively simple formula 
and requires only geographic and timetable data to calculate, 
a lack of software tools to complete the analysis
may be partly why it has not been more widely adopted. It is also unclear 
whether the patterns in Melbourne 
identified in @currie2010identifying 
have changed 
since the 2006 analysis, 
or if Melbourne is representative of other locations. 
Developing a software tool 
to calculate SI tools from GTFS data, 
and using it to comparing current conditions to the findings of @currie2010identifying, 
therefore, provides motivation 
for this research.


# Methodology

Case research approaches can be particularly useful when research questions are about 'how' or 'why', but researchers lack control of events (and so cannot use experimental approaches)[@Yin2009aa]. In this study the research questions relate to (1) how to use GTFS data to assess gaps between social needs and transit supply, and (2) how and why spatial patterns might have changed since those reported for 2006 in @currie2010identifying. There is no ability here to control events related to the spatial patterns of social needs and gaps in transit supply, so a case research approach appears well suited to this study. 

There is a need to address the "duality criterion" when using a case research approach, this being that the study should be seeking generalisable findings while at the same time being grounded in the context of only a small number of cases (thereby allowing cases to be examined in great depth)[@Denscombe2007aa; @Ketokivi2014aa]. Here the approach taken has been to develop a package of tools 
for calculating the SI from GTFS data 
using the R programming language [@R-base]. Using these methods addresses the duality criterion for the first research question, as the developed software functions are generic and might be apply to other GTFS feeds. As such they could be used to analyse spatial gaps in transit supply in other places (and by others), beyond the Melbourne case reported in this paper.
The recommendations of @wickham2023r 
informed the package setup and 
development approach. 
Various existing packages 
and code examples
were relied upon including: 
the sf package [@R-sf] for geospatial analysis; 
the tidyverse [@tidyverse2019]; 
gtfstools [@R-gtfstools]; and 
tidytransit [@R-tidytransit]. 
 

There are, however, limitations to the generalisability of the findings of this research with respect to changes since 2006 and the patterns reported in @currie2010identifying(research question 2). @Currie2007Identifying and @currie2010identifying reported results for Melbourne only. The 
@Currie2003Hobart and @Currie2004Gap studies of Hobart and Adelaide used earlier versions of the needs-gap assessment methodology, for which further software tools have not been developed. While this study does seek to findings about changes in spatial patterns of social need and transit supply that are generalisable to more than just Melbourne, a lack of 2006 results for other cities may limit the extent to which these findings might be confidently considered representative of changes in other places^[Other parts of this research programme will examine changes over the last 10-15 years in other cities (where GTFS data is available). The focus of this paper, however, is on Melbourne.].
 

## Code developement
Code was developed and tested on 
the Mornington Peninsula Tourist Railway GTFS feed. 
This was selected primarily for convenience, 
given that the authors are familiar with 
the surrounding geography 
and that the feed covers 
only a small number of trips across 
just three stations (thereby facilitating hand verification of outputs). 
ABS data was used to define areas of interest, and was sourced via the absmapsdata package [@absmapsdata].


## Melbourne Case Study

The methodological literature provides guidance on case selection and discussion of various theoretical sampling approaches, including sampling for critical, particularly revelatory and/or representative cases [@Eisenhardt1989aa; @Yin2009aa; @Denscombe2007aa; @Eisenhardt2007TBfC]. @Yin2009aa notes the selection of a case so as to allow longitudinal study, and it is this that is the primary reason for the selection of Melbourne for the research reported in this paper. 
This selection allows direct comparison with the 2006 results reported in @currie2010identifying so as to explore the extent to which spatial patterns of needs-gaps in transit supply have changed over the last 10 to 15 years. As such, SI scores were calculated 
using the same 
Census Collection Districts (CCDs) used by 
 @currie2010identifying, but for the weeks starting the day of the 2016 and 2021 censuses. 
 The Victorian GTFS feed, 
published by Public Transport Victoria (PTV), 
was used, with historical feeds sourced from @transitfeeds_victoria:2023aa. 



Unfortunately, it is not possible to obtain 
2016 or 2021 social disadvantage data for 
CCDs, as the ABS no longer releases data using this geographic scheme. 
Instead, population and other statistics are now released for 
Statistical Area (SA1) zones, under a hierarchical structure ranging from SA1s (~400 people) to SA4s (parts of a city or region). As such, SI scores have also been calculated for SA1s to facilitate the use of ABS data.

The same Transport Supply categorizations have been used as in @currie2010identifying (Zero, Very Low, Low, Below average, Above average, High and Very High). 
As well, this study adopts a similar approach to measuring social disadvantage 
as used in @currie2010identifying, using: 
the ABS' IRSAD and
a transport needs index^[The same need indicators and weightings used in @currie2010identifying were adopted, although
\$799 or lower per week was used
as the  threshold for low income households 
rather than \$499 
to account for inflation 
(as per the Reserve Bank of Australia's online inflation calculator).].
A composite needs indicator was derived 
based on the IRSAD and the transport needs index, 
again as per the @currie2010identifying approach. However, 
changes to the ABS reporting systems meant
that data necessary to exactly replicate the composite needs indicator used by @currie2010identifying was not available. The approach used here includes only two components in the composite needs index ^[In contrast to the four included by @currie2010identifying, which included two "relative need" components, obtained by weighting the IRSAD and the transport needs indexes by the population within the various needs groups in each area of interest. Current ABS reporting, however, does not allow the identification of the number of people within the various needs groups at the SA1 level. Hence, only two indicators could be included.] based on weighting both the IRSAD index and the transport need index by the total population of each SA1 zone. These were then standardised and grouped, as per the six groups used by @currie2010identifying^[Very Low, Low, Below average, Above average, High and Very High.].

# Results
## The gtfssupplyindex Package
Code developed to calculate SI scores 
is available as an R package on github (see @gtfssupplyindex_github).
Included in the package 
is a vignette (see Appendix) that outlines 
the developed functions and provides 
step-by-step calculations for the 
Mornington Peninsula Railway 
as a worked example.

### Transport Supply Categories 

Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_CCDs_SA1_table} summarises the distribution of CCDs and SA1s across different Transport Supply categories in 2006, 2016 and 2021. Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_CCDs_SA1_population} shows the spatial distribution of Transport Supply in 2021 (for the 2021 SA1 zones). A 2016 map is included in the Appendix.

There is a statistically significant difference in the shares of CCDs in each category between 2006, 2016 and 2021 (`r prmisc::print_chi2(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021 %>% select(ccds_2006, ccds_2016, ccds_2021) %>% as.matrix())`). Only `r si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>%  filter(transit_supply == "Zero Supply") %>% nrow()` CCDs (`r percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)((si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>%  filter(transit_supply == "Zero Supply") %>% nrow()/si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% nrow()))`) have Zero Supply in 2021, compared to the 189 (3.2%) reported by @currie2010identifying for 2006. Differences are also statistically significant when comparing 2006 and 2016 (`r prmisc::print_chi2(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021 %>% select(ccds_2006, ccds_2016) %>% as.matrix())`) or 2006 and 2021 `r prmisc::print_chi2(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021 %>% select(ccds_2006, ccds_2021) %>% as.matrix())`), but not between 2016 and 2021 (`r prmisc::print_chi2(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021 %>% select(ccds_2016, ccds_2021) %>% as.matrix())`).

These values, however, are only for CCDs within the 2006 extents of Melbourne. The ABS' statistical boundary of "Greater Melbourne" now includes areas up to around 30 kilometers further to the north, as shown in the 2021 map in Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_SA1_plot}. This shows that the new parts of Melbourne, beyond the 2006 statistical boundary, mostly have Very Low or Zero Transport Supply levels. Again, the difference between the share of areas of interest in each category in 2006 (CCDs), 2016 and 2021 (SA1s) is statistically significant (`r prmisc::print_chi2(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021 %>% select(ccds_2006, sa1s_2016, sa1s_2021) %>% as.matrix())`), but not between 2006 and 2016 (as a pair, `r prmisc::print_chi2(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021 %>% select(ccds_2006, sa1s_2016) %>% as.matrix())`). The differences between 2006 and 2021 are statistically significant (`r prmisc::print_chi2(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021 %>% select(ccds_2006, sa1s_2021) %>% as.matrix())`) as are the differences between 2016 and 2021 `r prmisc::print_chi2(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021 %>% select(sa1s_2016, sa1s_2021) %>% as.matrix())`). There is a greater proportion of SA1s with Zero Supply in 2021 (`r percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)((melbourne_si_SA12021_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>%  filter(transit_supply == "Zero Supply") %>% nrow()/melbourne_si_SA12021_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% nrow()))`) than there were CCDs in 2006 (3.25%) or SA1s in 2016 (`r percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)((melbourne_si_SA12016_16_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>%  filter(transit_supply == "Zero Supply") %>% nrow()/melbourne_si_SA12016_16_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% nrow()))`). The share of SA1s with supply below the average SI score (i.e. Zero, Very Low, Low or Below Average) is also larger in 2021 (`r percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)(1-(melbourne_si_SA12021_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>%  filter(transit_supply == "Very High" | transit_supply == "High" | transit_supply == "Above average")) %>% nrow()/melbourne_si_SA12021_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% nrow())`) compared to the share of CCDs in 2006 (70.3%) or share of SA1s in 2016 (`r percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)(1-(melbourne_si_SA12016_16_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>%  filter(transit_supply == "Very High" | transit_supply == "High" | transit_supply == "Above average")) %>% nrow()/melbourne_si_SA12016_16_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% nrow())`).

Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_CCDs_SA1_population} compares the share of resident population in each transport supply category.

 @currie2010identifying reported an average SI score for CCDs in 2006

 In comparison, the average SI value found here for 2021 (using CCDs and within the 2006 boundary) is 
 `r si_CCD2006_21_census_week_aggregated[["si_by_area"]] %>% select(SI) %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% unlist()%>% mean() %>% format(big.mark = ",", digits = 5)`. 
 SI scores of 10,922.7, 2,694.9 and 764.3 were reported for inner, middle and outer suburbs, 
respectively, for 2006 in @currie2010identifying. For 2021 the SI scores average

as used in @currie2010identifying was used for this analysis, 
although here the City of Stonnington 
was allocated entirely to the middle grouping, 
whereas @currie2010identifying allocated part of this LGA to the inner group.].
However, the @currie2010identifying results show 5,839 total CCDs within Melbourne, 
whereas the shape files obtained for this analysis include 
`r si_CCD2006_16_census_week_aggregated$si_by_area %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% nrow() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` 
CCDs within the 2006 Melbourne boundary. 
Hence, results found here might not be exactly comparable to those 
in @currie2010identifying due to geographic inconsistencies.
Overall, however, results appear to be consistent 
with there having been increases in SI scores 
across all parts of Melbourne since 2006 and 
the general pattern of higher average SI scores 
in inner (and then middle) than outer suburbs remaining unchanged. 

It is, however, possible to directly compare SI scores 2016 and 2021, 
using the SA1 2021 boundaries. Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021_ratio_map} 
shows changes in SI score between 2016 and 2021 (column 1) by 2021 SA1s 
for the 2021 population, summarised for each SA4 zone (columns 2 to 10) 
and Greater Melbourne as a whole (column 11). 
These are mapped in Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021_ratio_map}.

Average SI scores for all of Greater Melbourne 
increased from 
`r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider$x2016 %>% na.omit() %>% mean() %>% format(big.mark = ",", digits = 5)` 
 to 
`r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider$x2021 %>% na.omit() %>% mean() %>% format(big.mark = ",", digits = 5)` 
(+`r percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider$x2021 %>% na.omit() %>% mean()/si_by_area_2016_2021_wider$x2016 %>% na.omit() %>%  mean()-1)`). 
There is a statistically significant and strong correlation between the 2016 and 2021 SI scores 
(`r prmisc::print_cortest(cor.test(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider$x2016, si_by_area_2016_2021_wider$x2021, method = "pearson"))`,

There is a statistically significant difference in the proportion of SA1s in each service level change category across SA4 areas 
(`r prmisc::print_chi2(chisq.test( greater_melbourne_ratio_SA1[,2:10] %>% as.matrix(), simulate.p.value=TRUE))`)^[See Appendix for table]. In 2021, more than half of the population were living in SA1s where the SI scores were more than one percent higher than in 2016 in the North-West (`r greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[1:6,3] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people, `r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[1:6,3] %>% sum() / greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[,3] %>% sum())`) and West (`r greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[1:6,6] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people, `r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[1:6,6] %>% sum() / greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[,6] %>% sum())`) SA4s. This compares to slightly more than half of the population across Greater Melbourne as a whole
(`r greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[1:6,2:10] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people, `r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[1:6,2:10] %>% sum() / greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[,2:10] %>% sum())`),
and less an a third in the Inner East 
(`r greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[1:6,9] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people, 
`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[1:6,9] %>% sum() / greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[,9] %>% sum())`)

Service levels in 2021 stayed within one percent of the level in 2016 for most of the people living in the Outer East 
(`r greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[7,4] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people,

In 2021, the share of the population living in SA1s where the SI was more than one percent lower than in 2016 was largest in the Inner 
(`r greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[8:11,8] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people,

`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(sum(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[8:11,4]) /sum(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[,4]))`) SA4s. 
Accross all of Greater Melbourne `r greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[8:11,2:10] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people, 
`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(sum(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[8:11,2:10]) /sum(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[,2:10]))`) were living in SA1s in 2021 was more than one percent lower than it had been in 2016.

In 2021 `r greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[12,2:10] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` residents of Greater Melbourne (
`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(sum(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[12,2:10]) /sum(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[,2:10]))`) were living in SA1s that did not have transit service in 2016 or 2021. The largest proportions were amongst the  Mornington Peninsula (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(sum(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[12,"Mornington Peninsula"]) /sum(greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[,"Mornington Peninsula"]))`, `r greater_melbourne_ratio_population_wider[12,"Mornington Peninsula"] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")`) and

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_social_needs} shows the distribution of categories of social need index scores across Greater Melbourne for 2021^[A map for 2016 is included in the Appendix as Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_social_needs_appendix}]. This is analogous to the 2006 map shown in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} (b) although, as discussed in the methodology section above, it was not possible to exactly replicate the @currie2010identifying social needs scoring approach due to changes in the way census results are reported. In general, the spatial grouping of different levels of social need appears less consistently grouped in 2021 than in 2006, although this may be an artifact of the shift to SA1s from  CCDs^[CCDs were originally devised to group the approximately 200 dwellings allocated to each individual census collector, whereas SA1s were introduced to be consistent in population (200 to 800 people, averaging 400) and character [@ABS_SA1s_CCDs]].

Figures \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_map_figure} and \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_map_figure} show SA1 zones in Greater Melbourne with Very High transport needs, but Very Low or Zero transit supply for 2016 and 2021. Comparison to the 2006 spatial distribution shown in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} (bottom) suggests that areas with large gaps between social needs and transit supply continue to be mostly in the outer areas of Melbourne. However, such comparisons appear complicated by the larger number of SA1s than CCDs, with Figures \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_map_figure} and \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_map_figure} appearing to show more (smaller) areas with Very High transport needs, but Very Low or Zero transit supply. This includes areas in the West, North West, North East and South East SA4s, whereas in 2006 these parts of Melbourne did not appear to have large gaps between need and supply. The bottom parts of the Morning Peninsula (around Blairgowrie) drop out of the category of having the largest needs-gaps in 2016, but are back in this category again in 2021. 



### Needs-gap and service level changes

Tables \ref{Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_SA4_service_change} and \ref{Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_SA4_service_change} 
show how service levels changed for those SA1 areas that had 
Very High needs but Very Low or Zero service. These are 
summarised across S4 areas by population for 2016 and 2021.

There is a significant difference across SA4s in 2016 (`r prmisc::print_chi2(chisq.test(si_by_areaSA12016_2016_2021_wider_table[,-1], simulate.p.value=TRUE))`) and 2021 (`r prmisc::print_chi2(chisq.test(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,-1], simulate.p.value=TRUE))`). Of those people living in SA1s that Very High needs but Very Low or Zero service in 2016, those living in the North West, South East and West were more likely to have received some new or additional transit service by 2021. For those living in the Outer East, Inner South and Mornington Peninsula service levels were more likely to have stayed within one percent or been reduced, or (for `r si_by_areaSA12016_2016_2021_wider_table[11,6] %>% sum()` people living in the Outer East (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_areaSA12016_2016_2021_wider_table[11,6] %>% sum()/si_by_areaSA12016_2016_2021_wider_table[,6] %>% sum())`)) had their Service withdrawn (magenta) entirely.  


A larger proportion of those living in the Inner South, North East, West or Mornington Peninsula who were living in SA1s with Very High needs but Very Low or Zero service in 2021 had seen service levels reduced by more than one percent or had services withdrawn entirely or not providing in 2016 or 2021. This included the `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[11,4] %>% as.numeric() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people living in the North East (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[11,4] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,4] %>% sum())` of residents) and `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[11,7] %>% as.numeric() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people living in the South East (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[11,7] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,7] %>% sum())` of residents). A further `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[11,6] %>% as.numeric() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people living in the Outer East in 2021 (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[11,6] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,6] %>% sum())` of residents) were living in SA1s with Very High needs but Very Low or Zero service in 2021, which had some transit service in 2016 but none in 2021. A larger proportion of the population were living in SA1s with Very High needs but Very Low or Zero service in 2021 had not had service in 2016 or 2021 in the South East (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[12,7] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,7] %>% sum())`, `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[12,7] %>% as.numeric() %>% format(big.mark = ",")`), West (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[12,8] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,8] %>% sum())`, `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[12,8] %>% as.numeric() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` residents),  North East (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[12,4] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,4] %>% sum())`, `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[12,4] %>% as.numeric() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` residents) and Inner South (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[12,3] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,3] %>% sum())`, `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[12,3] %>% as.numeric() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` residents)



Service levels had increased (by more than one percent) for those living in SA1s with Very High needs but Very Low or Zero service in 2021 for a larger proportion of those living in the North West (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[1:6,5] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,5] %>% sum())`, `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[1:6,5] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` residents), the South East (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[1:6,7] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,7] %>% sum())`, `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[1:6,7] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` residents) and West (`r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)(si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[1:6,8] %>% sum()/ si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[,8] %>% sum())`, `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[1:6,8] %>% sum() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` residents). However, even those service levels had increased, they still remained in the Very Low category.






# Discussion

This research was motivated by a lack of software tools to analyse gaps between social needs for transport and the amount of transit provided, and to better understand how spatial patterns might have changed since the original development of this methodology in the early 2000s. The needs-gaps approach was suggested to be "substantially more useful than the presentation of anecdotal evidence, 
which is the most common means  of identifying transport needs in local transport studies throughout the world" [@currie2010identifying], yet this technique does not appear to have been adopted in practice. The research reported in this paper, therefore, is important because it may help bridge gaps between research (where the needs-gap approach and SI formulation was developed) and the real world of transport planning, advocacy, professional practice and politics (where decisions are made about where transit services are needed or need improving). 

As discussed in Section 2, there are many transit metrics available, but these may be challenging to apply or calculate independently. The SI has the advantage of combining accessibility and service frequency into a single measure, which is relatively simple to understand and can even be calculated by hand for smaller networks. With the gtfstools R package developed in this research applying the SI calculation across even relatively large transit networks, such as that of Greater Melbourne, requires only a GTFS feed, some computer time and a bit of data scientist know-how (or a willingness and time to learn). The tool is not yet at a download, point and click level of useability. However, it is open source and publicly available, and so may make it easier to assess transit service levels and network change proposals with respect to social needs for transport.  

The maps, graphs, tables and other outputs presented in this paper also demonstrate the range of analysis that might be possible using this package. Longitudinal comparison of transit service levels has been shown in aggregate (Table \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_CCDs_SA1_population}), by population across sub-areas (in comparing Tables \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_population_2016_by_SA4} and \ref{tab:Greater_Melbourne_population_2016_by_SA4}) and mapped (Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021_ratio_map}). Visual display of gaps between social needs and transit supply how also been shown through scatterplots (Figures \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_scatterplot} and \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_scatterplot}) and mapping (Figures \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_needs_gap_map} and \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_needs_gap_map}). Such outputs, especially if produced at the spatial level of a neighbourhood, council ward or electoral division, might provide an opportunity for advocates and professionals within transport planning to identify and easily demonstrate to the public, politician and other stakeholders which spatial areas might benefit from increasing transit funding and where funds might best be directed.  

<!---
An example of how the social needs-gap analysis and gtfssupplyindex package might facilitate such a demonstration relates to the `r si_by_area_2016_2021_wider_table[11,4] %>% as.numeric() %>% format(big.mark = ",")` people living in the North East in 2021 who had some transit service in 2016 but none in 2021, yet have very high needs, noted above. Figure \ref{fig:north_east_changes} highlights the two SA1s in which these people live, which are north-west of Epping, in the vicinity of Harvest Home Road. --->

<!---
Figure \ref{fig:north_east_changes} shows the Transport Supply categories transit routes in 2016 (top-left) and 2021 (top-right).  There appears to have been a rerouting and, as shown in the current (2024) transit map for the area (Figure \ref{fig:north_east_changes}, bottom-right) the 357 bus route no longer extends north-west along Eaststone Avenue. This results in the 674 and 641 people living in two SA1s more than 400m west of Edgars Road no longer having a bus stop within the buffer zone, and a withdrawal of service (Figure \ref{fig:north_east_changes}, bottom-left) as per the definitions used here. The analysis presented here might provide support for a resumption of service on Eaststone Avenue, although further housing development is underway in this area and transit services appear likely to change further. Indeed, the Route 390 shown in (Figure \ref{fig:north_east_changes}, bottom-right) appears to have been recently introduced^[https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/15643/309-city-the-pines-sc-via-eastern-fwy-and-reynolds-rd/]. 
--->

Previous research looking at bus services in new developments includes the @delbosc2015impact case study of the Selandra Rise planned estate in the south-east of  Melbourne. This study explored the impact of the, then newly introduced, 798 bus route (Figure \ref{fig:Bus_798}. The route was reported as having around 2,500 boardings per week and being used by at least one person in 35 percent of households within the Selandra Rise Estate, despite it not penetrating fully into the development and only 20 percent of the estate's footprint being within 400 metres of the route. Findings suggested that: the route was "performing an important 'social transit' function"; that "those who do use the bus use it very frequently (88 percent (of riders) at least a few days a week)"; "Most bus riders were young and could not drive or had no car available, making them quite reliant on the bus", and that it "frees up the time of other household members who would have had to provide lifts" [@delbosc2015impact, p.10]. 
Figure \ref{fig:Selandra_rise} revisits the Selandra Rise Estate, showing transport supply in 2016 and 2021, and changes in SI score for SA1s with Very High social needs, but Very Low or Zero transit supply.

Various transit routes appear to have been added to the area surrounding the Selandra Rise Estate between 2016 (Figure \ref{fig:Selandra_rise}, top-left), 2021 (top-right) and 2024 (bottom-right). After 2016 Route 798 was adjusted to penetrate into the estate, and Route 888 was added to provide a north-south connection along Berwick-Cranbourne Road. This appears to have been sufficient to shift some of the estate into the Low transport supply category in 2021, up from Very Low category in 2016. Figure \ref{fig:Selandra_rise}, bottom-left, however, indicates that some of the surrounding SA1s, however, still fall into the Very High needs and Very Low or Zero supply social needs-gap category, including some SA1s that have over 700 residents but did not have a transit service within 400 metres in either 2016 and 2021. That said, it appears that Route 898 has been added between 2021 and 2024, providing an additional east-west connection and coverage, suggesting that the ultimate transit network for the area is not yet implemented. 

What the information shown in the bottom-left and bottom-right of Figure \ref{fig:Selandra_rise} might suggest, however, is that areas in the vicinity of Casey Fields are underserved. Revising Route 795 so as to service areas north of Ballarto Rd, perhaps instead of duplicating parts of Route 796, might be one option to increase coverage and provide some stops for residents living in areas that did not have an transit within 400 metres in either 2016 or 2021. 


# Conclusions

This paper has reported the development of a new R package containing tools for identifying gaps between the social need for transport and the service provided based on GTFS data. It has also demonstrated how this package might be applied to the case of Greater Melbourne in 2016 and 2021, in the same manner in which @currie2010identifying applied the analysis approach to Melbourne in 2006.  

A motivation for this study was explore how spatial patterns related to transport supply, need and gaps have changed in Melbourne since 2006. To some extent the results indicate the challenges of making longitudinal comparisons when there are changes in statistical geography. The shift from CCDs to SA1s by the ABS appears to have allowed results to be output here are a finer scale than in 2006, due to the generally smaller size of SA1s and the way in which they are focused towards containing consistent land use patterns within each zone.  This contrasts to the CCDs, which instead denoted the areas within which one census collector operated. Unfortunately, this limits the extend to which the 2016 and 2021 results can be directly compared to those for 2006. However, it is notable that the share of the population living in areas wtih Zero transit supply grew with time from `r label_percent(accuracy=0.1)(sum(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021[1,3])/sum(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021[,3]))` (`r format(sum(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021[1,3]), big.mark = ",")` residents) in 2006 to `r label_percent(accuracy=0.1)(sum(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021[1,8])/sum(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021[,8]))` (`r format(sum(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021[1,8]), big.mark = ",")` residents) in 2016, and then again to `r label_percent(accuracy=0.1)(sum(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021[1,9])/sum(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021[,9]))` (`r format(sum(melbourne_comparison_2006_2021[1,9]), big.mark = ",")` residents) in 2021. How much of the change between 2006 and 2016 relates to the switch in statistical geography is unclear, but the difference between 2016 and 2021 suggests that more people and a greater proportion of the population are living in areas where transit stops are beyond typical walking access distance as time has marched on.   

Compared to the 8.2 percent (276,739) of Melbourne residents having very high needs but zero, low or, very low transit supply in 2006  reported by @currie2010identifying, this study found the equivalents to be `r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)((melbourne_sa1_need_gap_population_crosstable_2016 %>% filter(transit_supply %in% c("Zero Supply","Very Low", "Low")) %>% filter(composite_needs == "Very High") %>% select(population) %>% sum())/(melbourne_sa1_need_gap_population_crosstable_2016 %>% select(population) %>% sum()))` (`r format(melbourne_sa1_need_gap_population_crosstable_2016 %>% filter(transit_supply %in% c("Zero Supply","Very Low", "Low")) %>% filter(composite_needs == "Very High") %>% select(population) %>% sum(), big.mark = ",")` residents) in 2016 and `r label_percent(accuracy = 0.1)((melbourne_sa1_need_gap_population_crosstable_2016 %>% filter(transit_supply %in% c("Zero Supply","Very Low", "Low")) %>% filter(composite_needs == "Very High") %>% select(population) %>% sum())/(melbourne_sa1_need_gap_population_crosstable_2016 %>% select(population) %>% sum()))` ( `r format(melbourne_sa1_need_gap_population_crosstable_2016 %>% filter(transit_supply %in% c("Zero Supply","Very Low")) %>% filter(composite_needs == "Very High") %>% select(population) %>% sum(), big.mark = ",")` residents) in 2021. Again, the 2016 and 2021 values may not directly comparable to those from 2006 because of the statistical geography changes. However, these findings might again suggest that the situation is moving in the wrong direction, at least in Greater Melbourne. 

The extent to which the findings from this case study of Greater Melbourne can be confidently generalised to other places (relating to the duality criterion of case research) is a key question. Fortunately, the widespread availability of GTFS datasets together with the new gtfssupplyindex package means that it will be easier to analyse other cases. Exploring social needs-gaps in other Australian cities is an immediate direction for future efforts associated with this program of research. In the meantime, it would seem prudent to be cautious as to making assumptions about whether shifts in Melbourne are representative of everywhere else. The almost 50 percent growth in population in Greater Melbourne between 2006 (3.4m) and 2021 (4.9m) is towards the higher end of that experienced in other places (REFERENCE), although low-density development patterns that provide similar challenges for transit planning appear common both within and beyond Australia. The balance of spending between major projects (e.g. highways, rail-based transit) and introducing or increasing the levels of service of transit provided primarily to meet social needs for transport will be different in Melbourne to that in other locations. However, with a new subway connection through the CBD and a second freeway connection across the largest river currently under construction, and various other rail and road mega-projects either in planning or recently completed, Melbourne might be an outlier as far as the share of government spending going towards transport that is not focused on providing basic coverage for those who cannot otherwise drive or increasing service levels for those with the greatest social need for transit. The challenges in building business cases, increasing subsidies and otherwise introducing or increasing transit service would appear likely to be similar in Melbourne as to other places. Hence, it might be confidentially expected that the overall patterns, of the largest gaps between the social need for transport and the transit supplied being in outer suburbs and away from suburban railway lines, might be reasonably expected in other cities.  

As well as making comparisons of Melbourne across 2006, 2016 and 2021, this paper has expanded on the analysis approach developed in @Currie2003Hobart, @Currie2004Gap, @Currie2007Identifying and @currie2010identifying. The mapping of changes in SI scores (Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021_ratio_map}) and how these changes relate to transit routes and areas with large needs-gaps at a neighbourhood (Figure \ref{fig:Selandra_rise}) might be of use to transport planners, advocates, politicians and other decision-makers, and others seeking to build legitimacy for the improvement or introduction of basic transit service levels. It is heartening that the Selandra Rise Estate, where @delbosc2015impact found that what transit was initially implemented provide a very important social function and that there was a community desire for greater levels of service, now has more routes and higher service levels. However, Figure \ref{fig:Selandra_rise} shows that there were similarly under-or-never-served communities nearby in 2021, suggesting that the timely introduction of transit service to new development areas continues to be a challenge in parts of Melbourne. Further research might seek to confirm whether similar issues are evident in outer and new development areas of other cities, although this would seem likely to be the case in many other places.  

Overall, the research reported in this paper may help researchers, practitioners, advocates, other stakeholders and decision-makers obtain information about spatial areas that have gaps between the social need for transport and the transit supplied. @currie2010identifying suggested that using the Supply Index and needs-gap analysis techniques would be much preferable to anecdotal or other informal inputs to decision-making related to providing transit to meet the basic social needs for transport of communities. The software package and analysis approaches reported in this paper, enabling GTFS data to be directly used as an input, will hopefully allow the social needs-gap approach to be used more easily and widely.

Figures \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_CCD_2016_appendix} and \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_CCD_2021_appendix} show the distribution of Transport Supply categories across Melbourne in the weeks of the 2016 censuses, using the same (2006) CCD boundaries^[Note, however, that there are some inconsistencies in the CCDs included in Metropolitan Melbourne in @currie2010identifying (5,839) and the number included in ABS dataset used for this analysis (6,325).] as in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI}. The overall spatial patterns appear generally similar in 2016 and 2021 as they were in 2006, with higher levels of transit supply in inner areas and close to most railway lines. However, clear differences include: 

- areas in the outer west (around Melton) that had above average supply in 2006 had below average supply in 2016 and 2021. 
- some middle south-eastern suburbs along the bay (in the vicinty of Black Rock) and outer eastern suburbs (Ferntree Gully) have dropped below average, while a small areas in the middle to outer south has moved from being below average in 2006 to above average in 2016 (Kananook, immediately north of Frankston) and 2021 (Kananook and Bonbeach).
- there have been suburban railway extensions to the north-west (Sunbury) and north-east (to South Morang in 2013 and to Mernda in 2018). The former involved electrification to incorporate existing line segments (already served by country services) into the surburban network. Transport Supply to Sunbury, however, appears to still be below average, suggesting that not much has changed following the shift from service by regional trains to suburban trains.  For Mernda in contrast, there has been increases in service levels, with some areas now having Above Average supply. 
- Some areas, away from railway lines, have also shifted from below average supply in 2006 to above average supplies in 2016 and 2021, including in the middle north-west (Greenvale) and middle to outer south east (Narre Warren South).
- Services appear to have been introduced to some outer eastern (east of Gembrook), south-eastern (Koo Wee Rup, Lang Lang, Nar Nar Goon, Garfield, Bunyip and others) and southern (St Andrews Beach) areas.

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_social_needs_appendix} shows the spatial patterns of social needs in 2016. Compared to 2021, the spatial patterns appear similar, with some areas in the north-west (Gisborne) and south-east (Carrum Downs, Stoney Point) having Very High needs in both. Some caution may be required in making direct comparisons of many outer suburbs where residential development has led to the introduction of new SA1s for the 2021 census. In many areas, including in the south-west (Werribee), north-west (Romsey), north (Wallan, Beveridge, Mickleham) and south-east (Clyde North and Beaconsfield South), it appears there are still Very High transport needs but the spatial area covered on the map is much smaller due to the redistricting of larger SA1s into multiple SA1s. That said, it appears that: 

- social needs fell in the southern parts of Bacchus Marsh and areas around Melton (outer west); 
- social needs rose in some outer northern (Lancefield), eastern (Gembrook East) and southern (end of the Mornington Penninsula) areas.
