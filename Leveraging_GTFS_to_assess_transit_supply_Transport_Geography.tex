\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In many parts of cities and towns a key reason for providing public
transport services is to providing a basic level of mobility for those
who cannot otherwise drive themselves Some of the services, facilities
and activities that are needed for people to meet their basic needs and
participate in society may be within walking or cycling distance.
However, in many places, especially those with low-density landuse
patterns or limited transit servcies, it may be difficult or even
impossible to get around without a private vehicle. As well as lack of
access to an automobile, disability, youth or old age, socio-economic
status, lack of a drivers license, and many other factors might mean
someone is reliant on transit services for some or all of their travel
to and from places beyond their local neighbourhood.

Adopting social equity-focused approaches to transport planning might
suggest targeting higher transit service levels towards spatial areas
where there are higher social and transport needs.\\
Approaches for assessing spatial gaps between social needs for transport
and what transit is supplied have been reported in previous research,
including in \citet{Currie2003Hobart}, \citet{Currie2004Gap},
\citet{Currie2007Identifying} and \citet{currie2010identifying}. These
publications presented a transit Supply Index (SI) and used to identify
geographic areas in a few Australian cities where there were very high
social needs for transport, but very little transit service, or no
transit at all. This approach suggested a new way for transit planners
to identify and prioritise locations, targetted towards improving
mobility for populations who might not have sufficient mobility to meet
their basic needs or fully participate in society.

However, in almost two decades since the SI was developed there does not
appear to have been much further use of this approach. It is also
unclear whether gaps between social needs and transit supply have
increased or reduced in Australian cities; or if the spatial patterns
identified in Hobart \citep{Currie2003Hobart, Currie2004Gap} and
Melbourne \citep{Currie2007Identifying, currie2010identifying} are
similar to those in other places.

This may in part be because applying such methodologies elsewhere would,
at the time, likely have required bespoke data collection, cleaning and
analysis. Transit timetables were typically publicly available in paper
and/or PDF formats, while the analyses reported in
\citet{Currie2003Hobart}, \citet{Currie2004Gap},
\citet{Currie2007Identifying} and \citet{currie2010identifying} appear
to have been mostly based on special data provided directly to the
research by transit operators and authorities in each location.
Regardless, the volume of spatial and service data and processing needed
to produce a social needs-gap analysis may have put such analyses beyond
reach in most places.

Nowadays, however, the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and the
internet allows timetable data to be published in a standardized and
accessible format. More than 10,000 transit agencies publically release
data this way. Various tools for manipulating such data are also now
available, including software for validating, analysing and
visualizating GTFS, as well as a separate standard (GTFS-Realtime) for
sharing live vehicle locations \citep{GTFS}.

However, software tools for examining spatial patterns and gaps in
transit supply with respecial to social needs for transport appears
limited.\\
This gap and the lack of direct follow up to \citet{Currie2003Hobart},
\citet{Currie2004Gap}, \citet{Currie2007Identifying} and
\citet{currie2010identifying} provide the motivation for the research
reported in this paper.\\
This research included the developement of a new R package
(gtfssupplyindex) fpr calculating SI scores. Also presented in this
paper are results for Greater Melbourne in 2016 and 2021, matching the
most recent censuses, comparable to the 2006 analysis reported in
\citet{currie2010identifying}. Comparisons are also made to other parts
of Australia, so as to explore whether findings about Greater Melbourne
are generalizable.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: the next section
outlines the background to this research, including the formulation of
the Transit Supply Index (SI). Section 3 describes the study
methodology, followed by presentation of results in Section 4 and
discussion in Section 5. Limitations of this study, directions for
future research and a brief conclusion are provided in Section 6.

\section{Background}\label{background}

\subsection{Transit metrics}\label{transit-metrics}

There are many metrics available for benchmarking transit services,
including: those in the Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP)
Report 88 guidebook on developing performance-measurement systems
\citep{Ryus:2003aa} and in the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service
Manual (TCQSM)\citep{TCQSM:2013}; those used across benchmarking
databases and programs (e.g.
\citet{Florida-Transit-Information-System:2018aa}, \citet{UITP:2015aa}
\citet{Imperial-College-London:2023aa}; and the results available on the
.Transit Score website \citep{WalkScore:2023tg}. The Fielding Triangle
\citep{FieldingGordonJ1987Mpts} provides a framework for combining
indicators of service inputs, outputs and consumption to describe cost
efficiency, cost effectiveness and service effectiveness. More broadly:
\citet{Litman:2003ab} and \citet{Litman:2016aa} discuss some of the
traffic, mobility, accessibility, social equity, strategic planning and
other rational decision-making-based perspectives underling transport
indicators; \citet{Reynolds:2017ah} extends these into models of how
institutionalism, incrementalism and other public policy analysis
concepts might apply to decision-making processes relating to transit
prioritization; \citet{GuzmanLuisA.2017Aeit} developed a measure of
accessibility in the context of policy development and social equity for
Latin American Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) networks; and
\citet{Creutzig2020streetspaceallocation} introduced street space
allocation metrics based around ten ethical principles.

However, many of these metrics may be difficult to calculate, explain or
understand, especially for those who are not planners, engineers or
other technical specialists. Where pre-calculated transit metrics are
immediately available, such as on a website or other online platform, it
may not be possible to independently generate scores, for instance to
assess proposed system changes. Contrasting examples are provided by the
metrics in the TCQSM and the Transit Score metric
\citep{WalkScore:2023tg}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Transit Scores are readily available on the Transit Score website for
  locations with a published GTFS feed. The meaning of these Transit
  Scores also appears easy to explain, with the highest possible score
  of 100 representing the sort of transit accessibility that might be
  xperienced in the center of New York. However, the Transit Score
  algorithm is a black box, and scores cannot be calculated
  independently or generated for proposed changes to networks.
\item
  the TCQSM provides a wide range of metrics for measuring different
  aspects of a transit system. The TCQSM scores themselves appear easy
  to understand or explain, ranging from A (good) to F (bad), although
  the large number of metrics might be somewhat overwhelming for some
  users. The scores, however, can be calculated independently, given
  sufficient data.
\end{itemize}

\citet{Wong:2013aa} provides an example of what can be done with GTFS
data, open metrics and coding by reporting the distribution of various
TCQSM metrics across 50 USA transit operators. Code used in the
\citet{Wong:2013aa} analysis is available for those who might wish to
produce a similar study for other locations and systems. Producing code
that allows similar calculations from GTFS data, except for the SI
metric, is included in the objectives of this study.

\subsection{The Transit Suppy Index}\label{the-transit-suppy-index}

A generalized form of the SI equation, adapted from
\citet{currie2010identifying}, is:

\[SI_{area, time} = \sum{\frac{Area_{Bn}}{Area_{area}}*SL_{n, time}}\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(SI_{area, time}\) is the Supply Index for the area of interest and a
  given period of time;
\item
  \(Area_{Bn}\) is the buffer area for each stop (n) within the area of
  interest (in \citet{currie2010identifying} this was based on a radius
  of 400 metres for bus and tram stops, and 800 metres for railway
  stations);
\item
  \(Area_{area}\) is the area of the area of interest; and
\item
  \(SL_{n,time}\) is the number of transit arrivals for each stop for a
  given time period.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/Currie2010SI} \caption{Distribution of supply measure scores – Metropolitan Melbourne (2006), Source: Currie (2010)}\label{fig:Currie_map_SI}
\end{figure}

\citet{currie2010identifying} reported SI scores across Greater
Melbourne in 2006, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI}, and
identifing a general pattern of: more transit supply in the middle and
inner suburbs and along passenger railway lines; and outer areas tending
to have very low SI scores or no transit supply at all.

\subsection{Social need and needs gap}\label{social-need-and-needs-gap}

As well as measuring transit supply, \citet{currie2010identifying} also
assessed the social need for transit across Greater Melbourne using: the
Australian Bureaus of Statistics' Index of Related Socio-Economic
Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD) and a transport needs index derived from
eight weighted indicators. The spatial distribution of this composite
social needs index in 2006, reproduced in Figure
\textbackslash ref\{fig:Currie\_maps\_needs), indicates areas of above
average, high and very high social needs in 2006 were located in: some
outer areas, particularly in the east and south-east; and in some middle
areas in the south-east, north and west. \citet{currie2010identifying}
also identified areas with very high transport needs, but very low or no
transit supply,\\
as reproduced in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_gap}. This indicated areas
where service gaps might be of particular concern, Most of these were
located in outer parts of Melbourne in the north-east, south-east and
south, although there were also some pockets in the middle suburbs in
the west, north and south east.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/Currie2010Needs} \caption{Distribution of categories of composite social need index scores in 2006, Source: Currie (2010)}\label{fig:Currie_map_needs}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/Currie2010gap} \caption{Melbourne needs-gap in 2006 – very high transport need areas with zero or very low public transport supply, Source: Currie (2010)}\label{fig:Currie_map_gap}
\end{figure}

Overall \citet{currie2010identifying} found that ``8.2\% of Melbourne
residents have `very high' needs but `zero', `low' or `very low' public
transport supply.'' Using this methodology in transit planning appraoch
was also stated as being ``substantially more useful than the
presentation of anecdotal evidence, which is the most common means of
identifying transport needs in local transport studies throughout the
world.''\citep{currie2010identifying}

However, it does not appear that this approach has been widely adopted
in practice or further developed by researchers. Our suspicion is that
while the SI has a relatively simple formula and requires only
geographic and timetable data, the lack of a software tool to perform
these calculations may be part of the reason that it has not been more
widely adopted. It is also unclear whether the patterns in Melbourne
identified in \citet{currie2010identifying}, have changed since the 2006
analysis. Developing a software tool to calculate SI tools from GTFS
data, and then using it to comparing current conditions and other
locations to the findings of \citet{currie2010identifying}, therefore,
provides motivation for this research.

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}

This study developed a package of tools for calculating the SI from GTFS
data using the R programming language \citep{R-base}. The
recommendations of \citet{wickham2023r} informed the package setup and
development approach. Various existing packages and code examples were
relied upon including: the sf package \citep{R-sf} for geospatial
analysis; the tidyverse \citep{tidyverse2019}; gtfstools
\citep{R-gtfstools}; and tidytransit \citep{R-tidytransit}. Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data was also used, sourced via the strayr
and absmapsdata packages \citep{r-strayr}.

Two cases were used during the code development and testing, such that
results might be generated for real GTFS data. These are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  the Mornington Peninsula Tourist Railway GTFS feed; and
\item
  the Public Transport Victoria (PTV) GTFS feed, both in Victoria,
  Australia.
\end{itemize}

Both were selected primarily for convenience, given that the authors are
familiar with the typical service patterns and geography in Greater
Melbourne. Adopting the Mornington Peninsula Tourist Railway network,
which consists of only three stations, also facilitated hand calculation
of the SI as a cross-check of the results produced by the developed
package.

Figure @ref(Melbourne\_map)) shows the areas of interest relevant to the
code development and testing, and selected railway stations. Statistical
Area 1 (SA1) zones\footnote{SA1 zones are the smallest geographical
  areas for which results are reported in the Australian census.} were
adopted from the Australian Bureau of Statistics \citep{ABSmaps} as the
areas of interest, while SA3 zones\footnote{These are generally similar
  to Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries.} where used for
aggregation.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Mornington Penninsula Tourist
Railway}\label{mornington-penninsula-tourist-railway}

The Morning Peninsula Tourist Railway is in the outer south-east of
Melbourne, running on Sundays and Wednesdays between Mornington and
Moorooduc, with an intermediate stop at Tanti Park\footnote{see
  https://transitfeeds.com/p/mornington-railway/806/latest/stops}. A
GTFS feed from 2018 was selected for the purposes of tests, and for
demonstrating the code and outputs reported here.

\subsubsection{Public Transport Victoria
(PTV)}\label{public-transport-victoria-ptv}

The Victorian GTFS feed, published by Public Transport Victoria (PTV)
and with historical feeds sourced via
\citet{transitfeeds_victoria:2023aa}, was used for analysis of Greater
Melbourne and Victoria. SI scores were obtained for the weeks starting
on the day of the census in 2016 and 2021, which were on Tuesday 9th and
10th of August respectively.

\subsection{Measuring social
disadvantage}\label{measuring-social-disadvantage}

This study adopts the same approach to measuring social disadvantage as
\citet{currie2010identifying}, using: the Australian Bureau of
Statistics Index of Relative Socio-Economic Advantage/Disadvantage
(IRSAD); and a transport needs index, which included the same need
indicators and weightings as used in
\citet{currie2010identifying}\footnote{Indicators: Adults without cars
  (weighting 0.19); accessibility (distance to Central Buisness
  District, 0.15); persons aged over 60 years (0.14); persons on a
  disability pension (0.12); low income families (0.10); adults not in
  the labour force (0.09); students (0.09); and persons aged 5-9 years
  (0.12). Data was extracted from the 2021 census, including the
  disability pension data which is now available through the ABS rather
  than Centrelink. A income of \$799 or lower per week was adopted as
  the threshold for low income households, based on updating the \$499
  figure used in \citet{currie2010identifying} to account for inflation,
  using the Reserve Bank of Australia's online inflation calculator.
  Note also that the 2021 census reported low-income families rather
  than households, as was used in \citet{currie2010identifying}.}

This study also adopts the same approach as
\citet{currie2010identifying} for deriving a single combined indicator
of social need, based combining the ABS' IRSAD and the transport needs
index\footnote{See \citet{currie2010identifying}, page 34}. However,
\citet{currie2010identifying} included indexes weighted for both total
population within each area of interest, and for relative need based on
the proportion of the population within each social need component
group. Currently, however, ABS census data is not available to a level
such that the number of people in a SA1 zone who are within at least one
social need component group can be identified. As such, only a total
need IRSAD index and a total transport need index are computed in this
study for each SA1 zone, which were then added and standardised as per
the \citet{currie2010identifying} approach.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Code structure and
functionality}\label{code-structure-and-functionality}

Developed code is available and documented on github (see
\citet{gtfssupplyindex_github}). The structure of the package, functions
developed, and data tables are shown in Figure @ref(fig:SI\_ERD), which
indicates how the package takes input from three files: a gtfs feed
(gtfs.zip); a sf object describing the geometry of the areas of interest
for which the SI is to be calculated; and a csv file (included in the
package) defining the buffer zone distances for each route type. The
ultimate output is a si\_by\_area\_and\_hour table (Figure
@ref(fig:SI\_ERD), bottom-right), which reports the SI score for each
hour of a day specified by the user.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/SI_data_structure} \caption{Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the data structure and functions related to the gtfssupplyindex package}\label{fig:SI_ERD}
\end{figure}

The various functions included in the package and their output are
explained in the following, using the Mornington Peninsula GTFS as a
worked example\footnote{This paper itself was prepared in Rmarkdown and
  is available at
  https://github.com/James-Reynolds/gtfssupplyindex\_main\_paper. Code
  snippets used to produce the outputs of the worked example can be
  viewed there.} Individual steps are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  The GTFS data is loaded using\\
  the gtfs\_by\_route\_type function which also splits it into a list
  (by route\_type) of tidygtfs objects, using the
  filter\_by\_route\_type function from the gtfstools package
  \citep{filter_GTFS_by_mode}.
\item
  Geometry information about the areas of interest is loaded by the
  load\_areas\_of\_interest function using the sf package \citep{R-sf}.
  The resultant areas\_of\_interest table
\item
  The walking distance threshold assigned to each route\_type (mode) is
  then loaded, using the load\_buffer\_zone function.
\item
  Stops within the catchment walking distance of each area\_of\_interest
  are then identified using the stops\_in\_walk\_dist function. Figure
  @ref(fig:calculate\_stop\_in\_or\_near\_areas\_verbose) shows how this
  functions identifies the SA1 areas within the 800 metre catchment of
  all three of the Mornington stations.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  SI scores are calculated for a given time period using the si\_calc
  function, which first identifies the number of arrivals in a given
  time period at each stop using code adapted from an article included
  in the tidytransit package \citep{tidytransit_departure_timetable}.
  The area terms of the SI value are calculated, with the si\_total and
  hourly functions providing aggregation by area or by area and hour.
  Figure @ref(fig:SI\_mornington\_20181230\_output) shows the hourly
  output for the Mornington Peninsula Railway, adopting December 30,
  2018 as the date of analysis.

BOUNDARY

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021} shows SI values on census
day for Greater Melbourne in 2016 and 2021. Comparison to Figure
\ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} indicates that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Greater Melbourne Greater Capital City Statistical Area now covers
  a larger area than it did in 2006, with the northern boundary having
  shifted northwards by up to around 40 kilometres \footnote{See
    https://maps.abs.gov.au/?xmin=15884115.813179802\&ymin=-4689558.173698483\&xmax=16551869.692279067\&ymax=-4397262.977535984\&bottomlayer=ASGS2021:GCCSA\&toplayer=ASGC2006:SD}.
\item
  There are still many areas, typically in the outer parts of Melbourne,
  where there is very low or zero transit supply.
\item
  A similar pattern of higher transit supply near railway lines is
  evident, but there appears to be more areas with above average or
  better service levels further out from the centre of the city.
\item
  In general, above average, high and very high service levels appear to
  be more spread out, especially into the middle suburbs.
\end{itemize}

Comparing 2016 and 2021 suggests that the geographic spread of service
levels has remained largely the same, albeit with some areas that had
little to no transit service appearing to have new services.

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021_year_SI} compares SI scores
for Greater Melbourne across 2016 and 2021. Results indicate a
statistically significant difference, but there does not appear to have
been much change across median, mean, interquartile range or overall
range (See table)

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2016_2021_scatterplot} compares the
2016 and 2021 SI scores for SA1 zones across Greater Melbourne. Results
indicate a statistically significant relationship, and for most SA1
zones it appears that SI scores have remained largely the same in 2021
as they were in 2016. Of interest, however, may be a group of SA1s that
had SI scores in the range of 3-4,000 in 2016, but only around 2,500 in
2021.

\citet{currie2010identifying} also reported the distribution of SI
scores by category across the number of CCDs and the resident
population.

\subsubsection{Social needs}\label{social-needs}

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_social_needs} shows the
distribution of categories of social need index scores across Greater
Melbourne for 2021. This figure is analogous to the 2006 value from
\citet{currie2010identifying} shown in Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_needs}
although, as discussed in the methodology section above, it was not
possible to exactly replicate the \citet{currie2010identifying} approach
as the total number of people within one or more of social need
component groups (necessary to calculate the two relative need
indicators) are not reported in the 2021 census.

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2021_social_needs} appears to indicate
that there is no clear spatial pattern to the distribution of the
categories of the composite need index scores. This appears to contrast
to trend, albeit with some exceptions, towards very high social needs
scores in outer areas identified by \citet{currie2010identifying}
(Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_needs}). This may, however, be an artifact
of either the differences in the composite needs scores used in this
analysis (due to the lack of data to assess relative needs) compared to
the \citet{currie2010identifying} analysis. As well, the 2021 census SA1
zones generally appear to smalller than the 2006 Census Collection
Districts (CCDs) used in \citet{currie2010identifying}, especially in
outer areas. This will be associated with the growth of Greater
Melbourne's population and spatial dispersment, with many of the large
outer `Very High' CCDs shown in the 2006 map now split into many more
SA1 zones.

Figure \ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2006_2021_needs_gap_zones} compares
the number of zones\footnote{SA1s in 2021, versus CCD in 2006.} by SI
and social/transport need category between 2006 and 2021. Population is
compared in Figure
\ref{fig:Greater_Melbourne_2006_2021_needs_gap_population}

These results indicate that, in 2021, 66 SA1 zones, (representing
0.6\%of the total 11,138SA1 zones in Greater Melbourne) had no public
transport, but very `very high' social/transport needs. These zones have
a combined population of

\ensuremath{4.5074\times 10^{4}} SA1 zones, representing 45,074(0.9\% of
the total 4,885,773 population) live in areas with no public transport
but have `very high' social/transport needs. This compares to the 89
CCDs (1.6\% of the 5,720 total), representing 37,699 Melbourne residents
(1.1\% of the population) living in areas with no public transport, but
very high social/transport needs reported for 2006 in
\citet{currie2010identifying}.
