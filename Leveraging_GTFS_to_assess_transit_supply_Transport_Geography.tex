\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In \emph{Quantifying spatial gaps in public transport supply based on
social needs}, \citet{currie2010identifying} introduced a transit Supply
Index (SI), based on the rate of transit arrivals within an area of
interest. These were calculated for Greater Melbourne in Victoria,
Australia, and combined these with census data to map locations with
very high social needs for transit, but very low or zero supply.

Unfortunately, this approach does not appear to have been widely used,
perhaps in part because at the time it was first published the transit
Supply Index (SI) was not easy to calculate. The
\citet{currie2010identifying} analysis was based on combining multiple
operator databases and service frequency data that had been manually
extracted from transit agency websites. Nowadays, however, the General
Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) allows timetable data to be published
in a standardized format, with more than 10,000 agencies releasing data
this way \citep{GTFS}. Tools for analysing GTFS data are widely
available, but not yet one for calculating SI scores directly from GTFS
datasets. Another research gap is that it is unclear whether the
problems relating to social needs and transit supply identified in
\citet{currie2010identifying} in Greater Melbourne have gotten better in
the almost two decades since the original analysis. Nor is it clear
whether the spatial patterns of transit need, supply and gap in
Melbourne are representative of other cities.

These gaps provide the motivation for the research reported in this
paper, in which a new R package (gtfssupplyindex) specifically developed
to calculate SI scores is presented. The paper also reports results for
Greater Melbourne in 2016 and 2021, matching the most recent censuses
and allowing comparison to the 2006 result reported in
\citet{currie2010identifying}.\\
Comparisons are also made to other parts of Australia, so as to explore
whether the findings about Greater Melbourne are generalizable.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: the next section
outlines the background to this research, including the original
formulation of the Transit Supply Index, and an explanation of the GTFS.
Section 3 then describes the study methodology, followed by presentation
of results in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the results and the
limitations of this study, and outlines directions for future research.
A brief conclusion is provided in Section 6.

\hypertarget{background}{%
\section{Background}\label{background}}

\hypertarget{transit-metrics}{%
\subsection{Transit metrics}\label{transit-metrics}}

Even a brief search reveals many metrics available for benchmarking
transit services. Examples include: (1) those in the Transit Cooperative
Research Program (TCRP) Report 88, which is an extensive guidebook on
developing a performance-measurement system \citep{Ryus:2003aa}; (2)
online databases provided by the Florida Transit Information System
(FTIS) \citep{Florida-Transit-Information-System:2018aa} and
\citet{UITP:2015aa}; (3) those used in the extensive benchmarking
program undertaken yearly by the Transport Strategy Centre in the United
Kingdom, \citep{Imperial-College-London:2023aa}; and (4) a recently
developed methodology to calculate `blank spots', beyond typical walking
access distances to/from transit stops \citep{AlamriSultan2023GAoA}. The
Fielding Triangle \citep{FieldingGordonJ1987Mpts} provides a framework
for combining indicators of service inputs, outputs and consumption to
describe cost efficiency, cost effectiveness and service effectiveness.
More broadly:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \citet{Litman:2003ab} and \citet{Litman:2016aa} discuss some of the
  traffic, mobility, accessibility, social equity, strategic planning
  and other rational decision-making-based perspectives underling
  transport indicators;
\item
  \citet{Reynolds:2017ah} extends these into models of how
  institutionalism, incrementalism and other public policy analysis
  concepts might apply to decision-making processes relating to transit
  prioritization;
\item
  \citet{GuzmanLuisA.2017Aeit}, developed a measure of accessibility in
  the context of policy development and social equity for Latin American
  Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) networks; and
\item
  \citet{Creutzig2020streetspaceallocation} introduced street space
  allocation metrics based around 10 ethical principles
\end{itemize}

However, many of these, and other, transit metrics may be difficult to
calculate and complex to explain or understand. It is also unclear how
well suited transit metrics are to communication with those who are not
planners, engineers or other technical specialists, especially political
representatives and the general public. Where pre-calculated metrics are
immediately available it may not be possible for practitioners,
researchers or advocates to independently generate scores so as to test
proposed system changes. Sometimes it is not even possible to know
precisely how scores for the existing services levels are calculated.

Contrasting examples are provided by the metrics in the Transit Capacity
and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM) and the Transit Score metric,
readily available on the \citet{WalkScore:2023tg} website, A Transit
Score is available for locations with a published GTFS feed, eliminating
the need for any calculations. The meaning of these Transit Scores also
appears easy to explain, with the highest possible score of 100
representing what might be experienced in the center of New York.
However, the Transit Score algorithm is unpublished, and effectively a
black box. It does not appear that Transit Scores can be calculated
independently or generated for proposed changes to networks. In
contrast, the TCQSM provides a wide range of metrics for measuring
different aspects of a transit system. The TCQSM scores themselves
appear easy to understand or explain, ranging from A to F, although the
number of metrics is very large and this might limit the practicality of
using the TCQSM in practice for communicating with non-technical
audiences. All of these can be calculated independently, given
sufficient data, and \citet{Wong:2013aa} provides an example reporting
various TCQSM metrics across 50 transit operators. This analysis by
\citet{Wong:2013aa} is made possible by the availability of General
Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) datasets for each of the transit
systems

The GTFS is an open, text-based format, developed originally to allow
transit to be included in the Google Maps navigation platform
\citep{GTFS}. Figure @ref(fig:GTFS\_ERD) shows an Entity Relationship
Diagram (ERD) of the GTFS data structure, indicatating how GTFS data is
stored as a series of tables (agency, routes, trips etc.) with primary
and foreign keys (agency\_id, route\_id, trip\_id etc.) providing links.
While there are many software tools for analyzing, visualizing or
otherwise manipulating GTFS data, one to calculate Transit Supply Index
scores is not yet available.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{the-transit-suppy-index}{%
\subsection{The Transit Suppy Index}\label{the-transit-suppy-index}}

A generalized form of the SI equation, adapted from
\citet{currie2010identifying}, is:

\[SI_{area, time} = \sum{\frac{Area_{Bn}}{Area_{area}}*SL_{n, time}}\]

where: (1) \(SI_{area, time}\) is the Supply Index for the area of
interest and a given period of time; (2) \(Area_{Bn}\) is the buffer
area for each stop (n) within the area of interest (in
\citet{currie2010identifying} this was based on a radius of 400 metres
for bus and tram stops, and 800 metres for railway stations); (3)
\(Area_{area}\) is the area of the area of interest; and (4)
\(SL_{n,time}\) is the number of transit arrivals for each stop for a
given time period.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/Currie2010SI} \caption{Distribution of supply measure scores – Metropolitan Melbourne (2006), Source: Currie (2010)}\label{fig:Currie_map_SI}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Currie_map_SI} shows a map of SI scores across Greater
Melbourne in 2006, which was included in \citet{currie2010identifying}.
The general pattern appears to be higher levels of transit supply closer
to the Central Business District (CBD) and passenger railway lines, and
large areas wth very low SI scores or no transit supply at all in outer
areas.

\hypertarget{social-need-and-needs-gap}{%
\subsection{Social need and needs gap}\label{social-need-and-needs-gap}}

\citet{currie2010identifying} also assessed the social need for transit
across Greater Melbourne using: the Australian Bureaus of Statistics'
Index of Related Socio-Economic Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD); a
transport needs index derived by \citet{currie2010identifying} from
eight weighted indicators; and a combination of the two. The indicators
used in the derived transport needs index were:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Adults without cars (weight 0.19);
\item
  Accessibility, being the distance from the Melbourne CBD (weight
  0.15);
\item
  Persons aged over 60 years (0.14);
\item
  Persons on a disability pension (0.12);
\item
  Low income households (0.10);
\item
  Adults not in the labour force (0.09);
\item
  Students (0.09); and
\item
  Persons 5-9 years old (0.12).
\end{itemize}

Data was sourced from census information, except for the accessibility
variable and for the disability pension variable, which came from
Centrelink, the federal government agency that manages income support
payments. Figures \ref{fig:Currie_chart_gap} and
\ref{fig:Currie_map_gap} reproduce a chart comparing transport needs and
transit supply, and a map of areas with very high social needs but zero
or very low transit supply.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/Currie2010chart} \caption{Log supply score and need index values – Melbourne needs-gap study, Source: Currie (2010)}\label{fig:Currie_chart_gap}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/Currie2010gap} \caption{Melbourne needs-gap – very high transport need areas with zero or very low public transport supply, Source: Currie (2010)}\label{fig:Currie_map_gap}
\end{figure}

The results indicated that that there were service gaps of concern,
especially in outer parts of Melbourne where low density development
patterns make provision of transit more challenging.
\citet{currie2010identifying} found that ``(o)verall, 8.2\% of Melbourne
residents have `very high' needs but `zero', `low' or `very low' public
transport supply.'', and suggested that this approach was
``substantially more useful than the presentation of anecdotal evidence
which is the most common means of identifying transport needs in local
transport studies throughout the world.''

However, it doesn't appear that this approach has been widely adopted in
practice or academia.\\
Nor does it appear to have been applied to other places, except for
related studies of Hobart and Adelaide that preceded
\citet{currie2010identifying}. Our suspicion is that while the SI has a
relatively simple formula and requires only geographic and timetable
data, the lack of a software tool to perform these calculations may be
part of the reason that it has not been more widely adopted and why
formal needs-supply-gap analysis appear uncommon.\\
It is also unclear whether the patterns in Melbourne, where areas with
very high transport needs but zero or very low transit supply tend to be
in outer areas of the city serviced by buses, are similar to patterns in
other cities. Nor is it clear whether the patterns in Melbourne itself
have changed since the 2006 analysis.

Developing a software tool, and then using it to comparing current
conditions and other locations to the findings of
\citet{currie2010identifying}, therefore, is the primary aim of this
paper.

\hypertarget{methodology}{%
\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

This study developed a package with tools for calculating the SI from
GTFS data. The R programming language \citep{R-base} was adopted for
code development. Package development setup and workflow as described by
\citet{wickham2023r} was adopted. Various existing packages were relied
upon including: the sf package \citep{R-sf} for geospatial analysis; the
tidyverse \citep{tidyverse2019}; gtfstools \citep{R-gtfstools}; and
tidytransit \citep{R-tidytransit}. Some code was adapted from examples,
vignettes and other documentation in the tidytransit, gtfstools and
other packages.

Two cases were used during the code development and testing, such that
results might be generated for real GTFS data: the Mornington Peninsula
Tourist Railway GTFS feed and the Public Transport Victoria (PTV) GTFS
feed, both in Victoria, Australia. Both were selected primarily for
convenience, given that the authors are familiar with the typical
service patterns and geography. The Mornington Peninsula Tourist Railway
network, consisting of only three stations, also facilitated hand
calculation of the SI as a cross-check of the results produced by the
developed package.

Figure @ref(Melbourne\_map)) shows the areas of interest relevant to the
code development and testing, and selected railway stations. Statistical
Area (SA) zones were adopted from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
\citep{ABSmaps} as the areas of interest, and included SA3 zones across
Greater Melbourne (main) and SA1 zones within 800 metres of the
Mornington Penninsula railway (right). SA1 zones are the smallest
geographical areas for which results are reported in the Australian
census.\\
The census also reports results across the Greater Melbourne Greater
Capital City (GCC) zone and SA3 zone boundaries, which are generally
similar to Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries.

\hypertarget{mornington-penninsula-tourist-railway}{%
\subsection{Mornington Penninsula Tourist
Railway}\label{mornington-penninsula-tourist-railway}}

The Morning Peninsula Tourist Railway is in the outer south-east of
Melbourne, running on Sundays and Wednesdays between Mornington and
Moorooduc, with an intermediate stop at Tanti Park (see
https://transitfeeds.com/p/mornington-railway/806/latest/stops). A GTFS
feed from 2018 was selected for the purposes of tests and demonstrating
the code and output. Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data was also
used, sources via the strayr and absmapsdata packages \citep{r-strayr}.
The Mornington Peninsular Statistical Area 3 (SA3) zone and the
Statistical Area 1 (SA1) zones contained within it were adopted as the
areas of interest.

\hypertarget{public-transport-victoria-ptv}{%
\subsection{Public Transport Victoria
(PTV)}\label{public-transport-victoria-ptv}}

The Victorian GTFS feed, published by Public Transport Victoria (PTV)
and with historical feeds sourced via
\citet{transitfeeds_victoria:2023aa}, was used for analysis of Victoria.
SI scores were obtained for the weeks starting on the day of the census
in 2016 and 2021, which were on Tuesday 9th and 10th of August
respectively.

\hypertarget{code-structure-and-functionality}{%
\subsection{Code structure and
functionality}\label{code-structure-and-functionality}}

Developed code is available and documented on github
\citep{gtfssupplyindex_github}. The structure of the package, functions
developed, and data tables are shown in Figure @ref(fig:SI\_ERD). This
shows\\
how the package takes input from three files: a gtfs feed (gtfs.zip); a
sf object describing the geometry of the areas for which the SI is to be
calculated; and a csv file (included in the package) defining the buffer
zone distances for each route type. The ultimate output is a
si\_by\_area\_and\_hour table (bottom-right), which reports the SI score
for each hour of the day across dates specified by the user.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/SI_data_structure} \caption{Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the data structure and functions related to the gtfssupplyindex package}\label{fig:SI_ERD}
\end{figure}

Various functions and their output are explained in the following, using
the Mornington Peninsula GTFS for December 30th, 2018, and SA1 zone
boundaries as a worked example. Individual steps are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  loading the gtfs.zip file: the gtfs\_by\_route\_type function loads
  the gtfs data and splits it into a list (by route\_type) of tidygtfs
  objects, using the filter\_by\_route\_type function from the gtfstools
  package \citep{filter_GTFS_by_mode}.
\item
  loading geometry information about the areas of interest: geographical
  data about the areas of interest are loaded by the
  load\_areas\_of\_interest.R function into an sf object, using the sf
  package \citep{R-sf}. The resultant areas\_of\_interest table contains
  each area\_id and its associated geometry. Data about buffer zones,
  specifically the walking distance threshold assigned to each
  route\_type (mode) is then loaded, again through a function
  (load\_buffer\_zone.R).
\item
  calculating which stops are within the catchment walking distance of
  which areas: using the stops\_in\_walk\_dist function. Figure
  @ref(fig:calculate\_stop\_in\_or\_near\_areas\_verbose)) shows how
  this function identified SA1 areas within the 800 metre catchment of
  the three Mornington stations.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Calculating SI scores for a given time period: The si\_calc.R function
  calculates the number of arrivals in a given time period, using code
  adapted from an article included in the tidytransit package
  \citep{tidytransit_departure_timetable}, and combines this with the
  calculated area components. The si\_total.R and hourly.R functions
  provided aggregation, giving the results mapped in Figure
  @ref(fig:SI\_mornington\_20181230\_output).
